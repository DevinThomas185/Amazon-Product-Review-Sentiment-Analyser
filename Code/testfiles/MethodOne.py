reviews = ["I've been using the Sony 1000xm3's for 4 full days now. In the house, walking, in the car, on the bus and in a busy office. I thought now would be a good time to review them and share my impressions. I'll try to cover several things that I would normally look for when testing my stuff and hopefully this will answer any questions people have about these amazing cans!I've been using the 1000x for about 2 years at this point as my main drivers. So I'll point out any differences I've found moving from those onto the mark 3's.Comfort/Ergonomics:Padding on the headband and on the ear cups is extremely soft and hugs my head nicely, but without applying too much pressure. The leather is synthetic, but gives a quality feel. If you've had a paid of Sony headphones before you'll be familiar with the materials they use. The weight has been reduced since the 1000x, and I have to say I'm shocked at how much 20 grams make a difference! Thumbs up here.They have simplified the controls by reducing the button count, bringing it down to two buttons from three. This works better than before. Instead of having a button for power and 2 for noise cancelling modes, there's one for power and the other allows you to cycle through the NC modes. There is a downside to this however if you intend on using the google assistant feature, as the NC button will become the assistant button.The 3.5mm headphone jack and cable that comes in the box is a nice length, and when plugged into the headphones there is a good amount of grip holding onto it to ensure it's not popping out while you move around. But I was a little disappointed with the over all feel of the cable, it's thinner and more flimsy than the line that came in the 1000x.Sony's choice to change the materials on the cups was a good one. It's smooth and more responsive than the leather textured one from the previous generations, it also doesn't make as much of a rubbing sound within the headphone as you swipe.Sound Quality/Signature:I've tested these in a few different configurations to see how they perform.First way you can use them is passively with the headphones powered down. The player you are using will send the signal and also power the headphones directly. I feel like what you get from listening like this is a sound that is quite balanced and flat, however this is really going to depend on the device you're playing with.Next, power up the headphones and you'll notice right away that the signature of the sound changes as the headphones own amplifier kicks in. What you get here is more base response and a much crisper treble. It's a satisfying sound signature and it's how I prefer to listen.Bluetooth is likely how most people will likely listen I feel, and the sound doesn't disappoint. In terms of signature, the Bluetooth connection matches what you have in wired+powered mode.The sound is very nice and I've got no complaints here. Generally headphones will change ever so slightly over time as you break them in, but normally it's for the better so I'll assume that to be the case here also.Phone call quality is good and is improved over the previous versions, however it's not perfect. If you're in a noisy environment, they tend to pick up everything. There needs to be a little more focus on the voice.Connectivity:As I mentioned before, when using the wire the cable is held in place tight so there is no accidental popping out.Bluetooth performance has been perfect. I use LDAC in quality preferred mode which is effectively the most likely to suffer from drop outs due to the amount of data being transferred on that mode, but I've not had any issues at all.The headphones can remember several devices in the connection history so that you don't need to pair each time you connect a different device. You are not able to connect to multiple devices at the same time unless the devices are using a different bluetooth profile. An example would be having it connected to your Walkman for media playback, and also connected to your phone for calls, this is fine. Connecting to a Walkman and a Tablet for media playback at the same time would not work.The app that Sony provide for controlling the headphones features offers some awesome customisation of the settings, including the noise cancelling configuration, button configuration for assistant, equaliser setting and others.Google assistant works well enough, but I feel this is something that isn't very well suited to headphones - at least the way I'd use it, better just using my phone. I guess this will be user preference.Noise Cancelling/Ambient Features:As most people no doubt already know if they have been looking at these headphones for any longer than 10 minutes, noise cancellation is there reason for being. I have to say they do not disappoint! How Sony improved on the already amazing 1000x and 1000xm2 is something I'm sure other manufacturers would love to figure out, and keep in mind that the xm2 was already considered best in class!When walking there is no thud sound which you can often get from noise cancelling headphones, the sound of traffic and people is almost completely blocked out. The loud roar of the bus engine is also blocked amazingly while commuting. The volume of people talking in the office is also reduced with amazing results. Often with noise cancelling headphones with ANC enabled it can actually negatively effect the quality of the sound you're getting through from your music. I'm glad to say that the music comes through clean as can be with ANC enabled here.The ambient modes are something really special about this line of headphones, and they make your day much easier if you are spending a lot of time with a paid of these on. Quick attention mode works great as always, letting you hear what you need to and then getting you back into the music without having to take them off.I was slightly disappointed in the ambient sound voice mode on the xm3s. When this mode is enabled, the cans try and let the voice of someone through, but without letting too much of the back ground noise in. In the 1000x this was balanced perfectly and I could have a conversation with someone easily. On the xm3's however the balance is leaning more towards trying to keep back ground noise out, which means they don't pick up the voices as well as the 1000x in my opinion.There is also a wind noise reduction mode which is something I had no idea about as it hasn't been mentioned by any one else that I was looking at. I was blown away by how effective the wind reduction was, and the trade off was minimal!In the end if someone was to ask me if I'd recommend picking these up, I'd tell them that once they have a pair of these they will find it very difficult to go back to another headphone!These are going to be with me a lot over the next few years and I'm very happy with them.", "I'm sure you've read the reviews, and they're overwhelmingly positive. With good reason.They've a slight bass boost, but it works... Great sound, noise cancellation, reliable Bluetooth connection and a long battery make these 'phones the ones to beat.UPDATE:After a few months one of the ear cups become loose.  I contacted Sony, who said they would cover everything but accidental damage under warranty .Fair enough.I sent the headphones to Sony's repair centre explaining the issue was due to wear, not an accident, and they sent me a quote for \u00a3105 to repair, now saying they don't cover \"physical\" damage (not just accidental)... There's a big difference between the two.  So what on earth is covered under warranty?To me, this change to the warranty is dishonest, misleading and probably illegal.Thankfully, Amazon had my back and sorted it out.  If they hadn't, I would have had to pay \u00a3100 to replace a small bit of plastic.Thank you Amazon, up yours, Sony.", "I could not decide between the B&amp;W PX, the Bose QC35 or the 1000XM2. I knew I would regret not buying the other two if I chose one. So I waited, resisted the temptation to deal on the 1000XM2 price cut a few weeks ago. And then, by chance, came across the new XM3 version. A trip to John Lewis to try for comfort the PX, QC35, 1000XM3 and B&amp;O H9 and I made my decision. I spent all evening playing with them and my biggest reservation, that I might prefer the impressive treble on the QC35, was resolved by the Sony App. You can meaningfully change the music with an effective equaliser on the App. I have owned the Beoplay H4 and found them impressive enough but a bit plasticky, so my teenage son got them. (The sound wasn\u2019t full, my hunch being flat middle; I didn\u2019t have surprises dancing from bottom right cup to top left cup \u2013 those little pops of sound almost physically bouncing around your head, whereas the XM3 has plenty) And fat plastic about an inch above the ear made the H4 uncomfortable.  I\u2019ve experienced the B&amp;O App and the Sony App is far better. I have no negative issues with the XM3 at all (OK, they\u2019re boxed a bit cheaply...what\u2019s with that cheapo black cardboard ribbon lining\u2026.doesn\u2019t matter, the carry case is nice).I have never been happier with a new headset. And I loved the first version of AKG451, before build quality deteriorated. And the wired B&amp;W P5 sounded fantastic. As an intermediate Bluetooth measure I bought the Srhythm NC25 for a throwaway price (and they are really quite good). But these Sony cups, I want to spend the rest of my life with them. I\u2019ve just come off a phone call with the wife. She heard me clearly, so the phone mikes work. The sound cancelling is eery, it\u2019s that effective, I\u2019ve never heard the sound of silence before. I know the B&amp;W look better, but I didn\u2019t want the weight and I need headphones I can use when they lose charge, just by attaching a wire (apparently the PX can\u2019t be used with no charge and just a wire, so how do you use them for in-flight entertainment\u2026.these Sony\u2019s do come with the airplane adaptor.)  That copper trim elevates the look very effectively, helping them look understated rather than cheap. Weight saving justifies plastic, instead of B&amp;W metal, and the nifty copper trim softens the aesthetic compromise you have to accept with the XM3 versus the PX.I was worried that the XM2s were not loud enough. The XM3s are plenty loud (at my desk on half volume or less using the iPhone 8).The sound reproduction is the same with the NC on or off.Swipe works very well.I wear glasses. No issue.I\u2019ve walked out 15m to the garden with no loss of sound.Cups are oval long (not round) and deep, so comfortable. The leather does not feel like it will tear easily. The case is as compact as you can hope for. I\u2019ve managed to squeeze it into a Tumi shoulder bag together with a hardback book (a but lumpy, but I can zip it up).I\u2019ve been writing this while listening to Kate Bush, playing with the trebles happily. To check all-round I\u2019ve just put I\u2019m Not Scared on off the Introspective album. And then to go for bass a bit more, I\u2019ve done Streets of Philadelphia. And then\u2026.Galvanise. OMG\u2026.BOOM, then tickle!!Thank you Sony; the people who conceived, designed and built this must love what they do \u2013 they have made my world a much better place than I found it. They should be proud.", "I've just upgraded from a set of Bose QC35 (the mark 1s not the mark 2s) having seen so many amazing reviews about these headphones from Sony. In a nutshell, and for me, they're better than the Bose in virtually every way. Here's how I would compare them:COMFORTBose wins:  If anything the ear cups are very very slightly softer than the Sony's, but the difference is almost negligible. I can wear both for an hour without really noticing too much.SOUND QUALITYSony wins:  It's hard to describe why I find the sound quality better with the Sony. The biggest difference is the richness and strength of the bass with the Sony \u2013 it's incredible! The very deepest rumble is faithfully reproduced, more so than with any other headphones I've tried. It doesn't sound muddy or just bassy for bass' sake if that makes sense! Also the sound 'stage' (if that's the word) seems more expansive and impressive with the Sony \u2013 a recording of a classical music concert just has that little bit more surround sound sparkle to it, and actually makes listening to the music more engaging.BLUETOOTHBose wins:  So far the reliability and quality of the Bluetooth link is the same between the two headphones. However, for me the Bose's ability to connect to two devices and then pipe the sound through to the headphones from whichever device is outputting audio is very useful and something I miss with the Sony. With the Bose I'd leave it connected to my Macbook and my iPhone and regardless of which I wanted to listen to sound from, I'd just start the audio playing with the Bose selected as the audio output and the headphones would start playing the audio from the respective device. With the Sony, if I want to swap from the Macbook to the iPhone I have to manually click 'Disconnect' on the Macbook and click 'Connect' on the iPhone in the Bluetooth preferences. It's not a big issue and it's not like I'm doing it every 5 minutes, but I don't see why the Sonys can't have the same functionality.NOISE CANCELLINGSony wins:  I have yet to take the Sonys on a plane, but so far they do seem exceptionally good at blocking out background noise, particularly people talking \u2013 something which the Bose can't do quite as well. Also I love the ability to switch to pass-through mode so I can engage in conversations with people without having to remove the headphones, or listen to music whilst still being able to hear things around me.AUDIO CONTROLSSony wins:  I love the touch-sensitive pad on the right ear cup of the headphones \u2013 stroke it up / down to change the volume, left / right to skip tracks, and double tap it to play / pause. I'm still learning to be a little careful when doing this as it's quite easy to skip a track when trying to adjust the volume, but the idea is great. You can also put the palm of your hand on the whole ear cup to temporarily enable audio pass-through ... although I've felt a bit silly doing this if I'm honest! Fortunately there's also a temporary push-switch on the underside of the left ear cup which allows you to cycle through noise-cancelling, pass-through and everything (noise-cancelling and pass-through) off.POWER SWITCH / INDICATORBose wins:  It's a minor annoyance, but I prefer the sliding power switch on the Bose \u2013 left for off, right for on, push further to the right against the spring to enable Bluetooth pairing. Also when the Bose are on there's a little green LED on the bottom of one of the cups which stays permanently lit. With the Sony, there's a single push button which you press and hold to turn the headphones on or off ... but when they're on there's nothing to indicate that they're on! If music is playing then there's a blue LED which blinks once every 4 seconds, but otherwise nothing! So it's really hard to tell whether you've remembered to turn them off or not after you've finished using them! Whilst the headphones do have auto power-off, it's only after a certain length of time after the Bluetooth connection is lost. So if you've just stopped listening to music but are still near the Bluetooth device, they'll stay on until they go flat presumably!APPSony wins:  The Sony app seems more comprehensive than the Bose app, and allows you to customise more settings. The EQ is particularly effective and allows you to customise the tone of the music to your own taste \u2013 something which no doubt contributes to the fact that I prefer the sound of the Sonys to the Bose. I haven't used the headphones whilst walking, running or in public transport, but I'm intrigued with way the app says it can detect what type of activity you're performing and adjust the sound quality to suit. Similarly I'm curious as to the difference that the 'Atmospheric Pressure Optimizing' can make when flying in an aircraft ...Overall I'm utterly thrilled with these headphones, despite the little annoyances outlined above I still much prefer them over the Bose, mainly because of the improved sound quality and awesome bass response \u2013 it's addictive!", "UPDATE:The Firmware update 4.1.1 has REDUCED the effective Noise Cancellation by literally 60%. It's outright horrific. I am sitting right now in my office, and I can EVERYTHING, I can hear buses driving past, my colleague talk, keyboard typing, mouse clicking. doors opening outside down the hallway!!!I don't know what Sony has done, but this is CLEARLY a massive fault.I am awaiting Repair from Sony Repair Centre. I explained the situation and they asked me to send it off soDO NOT UPDATE FIRMWARE to 4.1.1, it is BROKEN.Pros:Sound is stunning, so much room to breathe, spacious and the bass depth is fluid, and clear.Noise Cancelling is currently unbeatable. Its dangerously quiet in traffic. Amazing, also doesn't make me feel nauseated unlike the BOSE QC35 II.Battery charges incredibly fast. 10 minutes from 0% gives 5 HOURS :|Comfortable and light. Fantastic noise isolation. Cups are snug. Headband adjustments feel like QC35II.Still cheaper than the Bose QC35 IIConsEars can get warm.Prone to grease Marks on matte finish plasticBigger case than BOSE QC35II", "Originally purchased theae through Amazon warehouse, however I received the XM2s in an XM3 box (pretty poor on Amazon's part!). I ended up getting them from a different source, and what can I say? These headphones are near perfect for me.Sound: Well balanced for the most part, and a great amount of detail. I have found myself listening to my favourite albums like it was the first time I have heard them (bear in mind I have come from a pair of AKG in ears which came with my phone). They do seem a little bass focused, which cannot be adjusted when using high quality audio, however this by no means ruins the immersion for me. If you do not have the high quality audio selected, you can play around with different sound stages (such as arena, concert hall, club etc.) Which completely changes the sound. You can get lost in your own little bubble for hours without realising.Noise Cancellation: When the NC is on, the outside world is shut off. It is not completely silent, but I would say about 90% of the noise from my kettle was gone. I could not hear any droning noises from passing cars, or voices from different rooms (my partner was singing loud in the shower, but I had no idea until I took the headset off!). You can still hear voices in the same room if you have no music playing, however the noise is drastically reduced. Can't fault it.Build quality/comfort: These took a little getting used to for me, but once you find what is most comfortable for your head they are easily wearable for long periods of time. I have worn these for 4 hours straight today with no discomfort/ear sweat. The cups are big enough to fit around the whole ear without crushing them, however it can get a bit warm (not to the point when you will NEED to take them off). Build quality is great, the headband and cups are very soft and the touch controls work very well once you get used to the positioning.I once never thought I would spend this much on a pair of headphones, but I have absolutely no regrets with these.", "I have had the Sony WH-1000XM2 previously, so here are the key differences with the Sony WH-1000XM3 (third model):* XM3 model is much lighter (XM2 could become heavy after a while, and would give me tension headaches) and more comfortable (better padding, bigger ear pads)* Less gap between head and headphones, looks better while being worn* I do like the new look with copper highlights/branding* Carry case now has space for the 3.5mm audio cable, the (very short) charging USB-C cable and the plane adapter* Headphones can be used now without music, just on noise cancelling (no active bluetooth connection). MX2 would switch off automatically* When not playing music, the white noise/hiss produced by the Active Noise Cancelling is a lot less pronounced (so much better at just being used for silence)* Noise cancelling still works very well. Is it better? Probably slighly. Would cancel noise of kids playing on the street, a radio playing music, a spinning washing machine, noisy neighbors etc.* Sound quality is still great. Is it better? I was already very happy with the MX2 to be honest, particularly when playing music via the LDAC codec built in Android phones* When pressing the power button once, the voice now says the actual battery level in percentage, as opposed to just low/medium/highOverall, a great upgrade from the XM2 model, and probably top of the class now in term of bluetooth headphones with active noise cancelling.If only Sony could just allow for multiple bluetooth sources to be connected at the same time (via firmware update?), and also for the touch control to be disabled/locked (e.g. when sleeping), those headphones would just be perfect!They are expensive, but I think Active Noise Cancelling only really works on high end models, due to processing power required.", "The downside: The quality control of this model seems to be way lower than I would expect for this price. I\u2019ve had and returned two of these now. I know a couple of friends who\u2019ve had similar issues.That said, after a couple of returns, I got a good set and they are great! They make commuting in London a lot more chill as they sort of remove most of the hustle and bustle and just leave you in a bubble with your music.As I\u2019m sure a lot of other reviews have said, they don\u2019t remove screetching hogher frequencies like bad track on the tube, but if you\u2019re on a train with a good section it\u2019s amazing how quiet everything is.And the sound quality is really very nice. It\u2019s a shame that so few devices will use Sonys high quality LDAC, as the AAC on iOS is good but not great. If you do need extra clarity and beautiful sound quality, listening with the cord attached and uncompressed music like FLACs does yield an improvement.That said, they are very pleasant to listen to wirelessly. I also have a high quality set of in ears, which reduce outside sound a ton - and these compliment them well for days when I have ear fatigue from too much deep in ear time. The quality of isolation from the two is different. The in ears dampen treble more than bass, and these dampen bass more than treble. I\u2019d love a solution that managed both. But what these do is you can set the level of ambient sound coming in. In ears, I keed to pull them out every time which can get annoying.Below is my old review before I got the good pair.The first had AMAZING noise cancelling, but the mic wouldn\u2019t work for phonecalls. The second pair had working microphones for voice calls, but the noise cancelling was only roughly half as good, and the train sound was really very annoyingly loud. Luckily the third set had no issues. I imagine it was from a new run as it came preloaded with firmware 2.0, whereas the buggier two early examples I returned both shipped with Version 1.0 and I updated.", "The sound is wonderful, the noise cancelling magical, the headphones comfortable.So why one star?Because the quality of the microphone and / the digital processing of the voice makes them unusable for phone calls.And if they are unusable for phone calls, then they are unusable period.When a phone call came in, i had to plug in my \u00a36.99 wired generic headphones to have a conversation.After paying \u00a3329... ridiculous.Sent back for a refund.Sad really, Sony achieved the  hard challenge (sound quality &amp; NC)  but failed on the easy part. (Simple phone conversation)", "I had a pair of Bose 35s which I have 'passed on to' my brother as a pre-xmas gift. After reading the reviews decided to plunge, I have to say vs the Bose 35s these nail it totally. The bass is tighter and more extended, the sound stage better with all sounds being very well de-marked and not spoiling the vocals, the Bose I found at times with my personal preference of Rock music can get to be a bit of a mashed up mess especially if there are a lot of guitars.  Listening to Shine on you crazy diamond this morning was just bliss and having spent the last 2 yrs using the Bose35s I can definitely say these come out on top.The noise cancelling is different class vs the Bose almost to the point of when commuting you have to be very aware as you  just cannot pick out outside sounds period when music is on. The touch controls were a bit fiddly to start with but once you get used to it it works well. Finally i do like, even though the action itself is kinda wrong, to mute the sound and noise cancelling cup the right ear with you hand and you hear train announcements or people talking to you  etc which was a nice touch.The battery  is strong had well over 25hrs first useage and I find the comfort level of the phones nice, wore them for 2hrs this morning and didn't even get hot ears! which is a first for wireless phones.North of \u00a3300 is a lot to pay for a set of headphones but like many reviews these are the best around this price point IMO and I can compare them to their nearest  rival the Bose35, I certainly rate the Sony's higher, I do think though like HIFI once you start spending serious money the end product gets to be Subjective.", "I've been using the Sony 1000xm3's for 4 full days now.

I feel like what you get from listening like this is a sound that is quite balanced and flat, however this is really going to depend on the device you're playing with.Next, power up the headphones and you'll notice right away that the signature of the sound changes as the headphones own amplifier kicks in. What you get here is more base response and a much crisper treble. It's a satisfying sound signature and it's how I prefer to listen.Bluetooth is likely how most people will likely listen I feel, and the sound doesn't disappoint. In terms of signature, the Bluetooth connection matches what you have in wired+powered mode.The sound is very nice and I've got no complaints here. Generally headphones will change ever so slightly over time as you break them in, but normally it's for the better so I'll assume that to be the case here also.Phone call quality is good and is improved over the previous versions, however it's not perfect. If you're in a noisy environment, they tend to pick up everything. There needs to be a little more focus on the voice.Connectivity:As I mentioned before, when using the wire the cable is held in place tight so there is no accidental popping out.Bluetooth performance has been perfect. I use LDAC in quality preferred mode which is effectively the most likely to suffer from drop outs due to the amount of data being transferred on that mode, but I've not had any issues at all.The headphones can remember several devices in the connection history so that you don't need to pair each time you connect a different device. You are not able to connect to multiple devices at the same time unless the devices are using a different bluetooth profile. An example would be having it connected to your Walkman for media playback, and also connected to your phone for calls, this is fine. Connecting to a Walkman and a Tablet for media playback at the same time would not work.The app that Sony provide for controlling the headphones features offers some awesome customisation of the settings, including the noise cancelling configuration, button configuration for assistant, equaliser setting and others.Google assistant works well enough, but I feel this is something that isn't very well suited to headphones - at least the way I'd use it, better just using my phone. I guess this will be user preference.Noise Cancelling/Ambient Features:As most people no doubt already know if they have been looking at these headphones for any longer than 10 minutes, noise cancellation is there reason for being. I have to say they do not disappoint! How Sony improved on the already amazing 1000x and 1000xm2 is something I'm sure other manufacturers would love to figure out, and keep in mind that the xm2 was already considered best in class!When walking there is no thud sound which you can often get from noise cancelling headphones, the sound of traffic and people is almost completely blocked out. The loud roar of the bus engine is also blocked amazingly while commuting. The volume of people talking in the office is also reduced with amazing results. Often with noise cancelling headphones with ANC enabled it can actually negatively effect the quality of the sound you're getting through from your music. I'm glad to say that the music comes through clean as can be with ANC enabled here.The ambient modes are something really special about this line of headphones, and they make your day much easier if you are spending a lot of time with a paid of these on. Quick attention mode works great as always, letting you hear what you need to and then getting you back into the music without having to take them off.I was slightly disappointed in the ambient sound voice mode on the xm3s. When this mode is enabled, the cans try and let the voice of someone through, but without letting too much of the back ground noise in. In the 1000x this was balanced perfectly and I could have a conversation with someone easily. On the xm3's however the balance is leaning more towards trying to keep back ground noise out, which means they don't pick up the voices as well as the 1000x in my opinion.There is also a wind noise reduction mode which is something I had no idea about as it hasn't been mentioned by any one else that I was looking at. I was blown away by how effective the wind reduction was, and the trade off was minimal!In the end if someone was to ask me if I'd recommend picking these up, I'd tell them that once they have a pair of these they will find it very difficult to go back to another headphone!These are going to be with me a lot over the next few years and I'm very happy with them.", "I'm sure you've read the reviews, and they're overwhelmingly positive. With good reason.They've a slight bass boost, but it works... Great sound, noise cancellation, reliable Bluetooth connection and a long battery make these 'phones the ones to beat.UPDATE:After a few months one of the ear cups become loose.  I contacted Sony, who said they would cover everything but accidental damage under warranty .Fair enough.I sent the headphones to Sony's repair centre explaining the issue was due to wear, not an accident, and they sent me a quote for \u00a3105 to repair, now saying they don't cover \"physical\" damage (not just accidental)... There's a big difference between the two.  So what on earth is covered under warranty?To me, this change to the warranty is dishonest, misleading and probably illegal.Thankfully, Amazon had my back and sorted it out.  If they hadn't, I would have had to pay \u00a3100 to replace a small bit of plastic.Thank you Amazon, up yours, Sony.", "I could not decide between the B&amp;W PX, the Bose QC35 or the 1000XM2. I knew I would regret not buying the other two if I chose one. So I waited, resisted the temptation to deal on the 1000XM2 price cut a few weeks ago. And then, by chance, came across the new XM3 version. A trip to John Lewis to try for comfort the PX, QC35, 1000XM3 and B&amp;O H9 and I made my decision. I spent all evening playing with them and my biggest reservation, that I might prefer the impressive treble on the QC35, was resolved by the Sony App. You can meaningfully change the music with an effective equaliser on the App. I have owned the Beoplay H4 and found them impressive enough but a bit plasticky, so my teenage son got them. (The sound wasn\u2019t full, my hunch being flat middle; I didn\u2019t have surprises dancing from bottom right cup to top left cup \u2013 those little pops of sound almost physically bouncing around your head, whereas the XM3 has plenty) And fat plastic about an inch above the ear made the H4 uncomfortable.  I\u2019ve experienced the B&amp;O App and the Sony App is far better. I have no negative issues with the XM3 at all (OK, they\u2019re boxed a bit cheaply...what\u2019s with that cheapo black cardboard ribbon lining\u2026.doesn\u2019t matter, the carry case is nice).I have never been happier with a new headset. And I loved the first version of AKG451, before build quality deteriorated. And the wired B&amp;W P5 sounded fantastic. As an intermediate Bluetooth measure I bought the Srhythm NC25 for a throwaway price (and they are really quite good). But these Sony cups, I want to spend the rest of my life with them. I\u2019ve just come off a phone call with the wife. She heard me clearly, so the phone mikes work. The sound cancelling is eery, it\u2019s that effective, I\u2019ve never heard the sound of silence before. I know the B&amp;W look better, but I didn\u2019t want the weight and I need headphones I can use when they lose charge, just by attaching a wire (apparently the PX can\u2019t be used with no charge and just a wire, so how do you use them for in-flight entertainment\u2026.these Sony\u2019s do come with the airplane adaptor.)  That copper trim elevates the look very effectively, helping them look understated rather than cheap. Weight saving justifies plastic, instead of B&amp;W metal, and the nifty copper trim softens the aesthetic compromise you have to accept with the XM3 versus the PX.I was worried that the XM2s were not loud enough. The XM3s are plenty loud (at my desk on half volume or less using the iPhone 8).The sound reproduction is the same with the NC on or off.Swipe works very well.I wear glasses. No issue.I\u2019ve walked out 15m to the garden with no loss of sound.Cups are oval long (not round) and deep, so comfortable. The leather does not feel like it will tear easily. The case is as compact as you can hope for. I\u2019ve managed to squeeze it into a Tumi shoulder bag together with a hardback book (a but lumpy, but I can zip it up).I\u2019ve been writing this while listening to Kate Bush, playing with the trebles happily. To check all-round I\u2019ve just put I\u2019m Not Scared on off the Introspective album. And then to go for bass a bit more, I\u2019ve done Streets of Philadelphia. And then\u2026.Galvanise. OMG\u2026.BOOM, then tickle!!Thank you Sony; the people who conceived, designed and built this must love what they do \u2013 they have made my world a much better place than I found it. They should be proud.", "I've just upgraded from a set of Bose QC35 (the mark 1s not the mark 2s) having seen so many amazing reviews about these headphones from Sony. In a nutshell, and for me, they're better than the Bose in virtually every way. Here's how I would compare them:COMFORTBose wins:  If anything the ear cups are very very slightly softer than the Sony's, but the difference is almost negligible. I can wear both for an hour without really noticing too much.SOUND QUALITYSony wins:  It's hard to describe why I find the sound quality better with the Sony. The biggest difference is the richness and strength of the bass with the Sony \u2013 it's incredible! The very deepest rumble is faithfully reproduced, more so than with any other headphones I've tried. It doesn't sound muddy or just bassy for bass' sake if that makes sense! Also the sound 'stage' (if that's the word) seems more expansive and impressive with the Sony \u2013 a recording of a classical music concert just has that little bit more surround sound sparkle to it, and actually makes listening to the music more engaging.BLUETOOTHBose wins:  So far the reliability and quality of the Bluetooth link is the same between the two headphones. However, for me the Bose's ability to connect to two devices and then pipe the sound through to the headphones from whichever device is outputting audio is very useful and something I miss with the Sony. With the Bose I'd leave it connected to my Macbook and my iPhone and regardless of which I wanted to listen to sound from, I'd just start the audio playing with the Bose selected as the audio output and the headphones would start playing the audio from the respective device. With the Sony, if I want to swap from the Macbook to the iPhone I have to manually click 'Disconnect' on the Macbook and click 'Connect' on the iPhone in the Bluetooth preferences. It's not a big issue and it's not like I'm doing it every 5 minutes, but I don't see why the Sonys can't have the same functionality.NOISE CANCELLINGSony wins:  I have yet to take the Sonys on a plane, but so far they do seem exceptionally good at blocking out background noise, particularly people talking \u2013 something which the Bose can't do quite as well. Also I love the ability to switch to pass-through mode so I can engage in conversations with people without having to remove the headphones, or listen to music whilst still being able to hear things around me.AUDIO CONTROLSSony wins:  I love the touch-sensitive pad on the right ear cup of the headphones \u2013 stroke it up / down to change the volume, left / right to skip tracks, and double tap it to play / pause. I'm still learning to be a little careful when doing this as it's quite easy to skip a track when trying to adjust the volume, but the idea is great. You can also put the palm of your hand on the whole ear cup to temporarily enable audio pass-through ... although I've felt a bit silly doing this if I'm honest! Fortunately there's also a temporary push-switch on the underside of the left ear cup which allows you to cycle through noise-cancelling, pass-through and everything (noise-cancelling and pass-through) off.POWER SWITCH / INDICATORBose wins:  It's a minor annoyance, but I prefer the sliding power switch on the Bose \u2013 left for off, right for on, push further to the right against the spring to enable Bluetooth pairing. Also when the Bose are on there's a little green LED on the bottom of one of the cups which stays permanently lit. With the Sony, there's a single push button which you press and hold to turn the headphones on or off ... but when they're on there's nothing to indicate that they're on! If music is playing then there's a blue LED which blinks once every 4 seconds, but otherwise nothing! So it's really hard to tell whether you've remembered to turn them off or not after you've finished using them! Whilst the headphones do have auto power-off, it's only after a certain length of time after the Bluetooth connection is lost. So if you've just stopped listening to music but are still near the Bluetooth device, they'll stay on until they go flat presumably!APPSony wins:  The Sony app seems more comprehensive than the Bose app, and allows you to customise more settings. The EQ is particularly effective and allows you to customise the tone of the music to your own taste \u2013 something which no doubt contributes to the fact that I prefer the sound of the Sonys to the Bose. I haven't used the headphones whilst walking, running or in public transport, but I'm intrigued with way the app says it can detect what type of activity you're performing and adjust the sound quality to suit. Similarly I'm curious as to the difference that the 'Atmospheric Pressure Optimizing' can make when flying in an aircraft ...Overall I'm utterly thrilled with these headphones, despite the little annoyances outlined above I still much prefer them over the Bose, mainly because of the improved sound quality and awesome bass response \u2013 it's addictive!", "UPDATE:The Firmware update 4.1.1 has REDUCED the effective Noise Cancellation by literally 60%. It's outright horrific. I am sitting right now in my office, and I can EVERYTHING, I can hear buses driving past, my colleague talk, keyboard typing, mouse clicking. doors opening outside down the hallway!!!I don't know what Sony has done, but this is CLEARLY a massive fault.I am awaiting Repair from Sony Repair Centre. I explained the situation and they asked me to send it off soDO NOT UPDATE FIRMWARE to 4.1.1, it is BROKEN.Pros:Sound is stunning, so much room to breathe, spacious and the bass depth is fluid, and clear.Noise Cancelling is currently unbeatable. Its dangerously quiet in traffic. Amazing, also doesn't make me feel nauseated unlike the BOSE QC35 II.Battery charges incredibly fast. 10 minutes from 0% gives 5 HOURS :|Comfortable and light. Fantastic noise isolation. Cups are snug. Headband adjustments feel like QC35II.Still cheaper than the Bose QC35 IIConsEars can get warm.Prone to grease Marks on matte finish plasticBigger case than BOSE QC35II", "Originally purchased theae through Amazon warehouse, however I received the XM2s in an XM3 box (pretty poor on Amazon's part!). I ended up getting them from a different source, and what can I say? These headphones are near perfect for me.Sound: Well balanced for the most part, and a great amount of detail. I have found myself listening to my favourite albums like it was the first time I have heard them (bear in mind I have come from a pair of AKG in ears which came with my phone). They do seem a little bass focused, which cannot be adjusted when using high quality audio, however this by no means ruins the immersion for me. If you do not have the high quality audio selected, you can play around with different sound stages (such as arena, concert hall, club etc.) Which completely changes the sound. You can get lost in your own little bubble for hours without realising.Noise Cancellation: When the NC is on, the outside world is shut off. It is not completely silent, but I would say about 90% of the noise from my kettle was gone. I could not hear any droning noises from passing cars, or voices from different rooms (my partner was singing loud in the shower, but I had no idea until I took the headset off!). You can still hear voices in the same room if you have no music playing, however the noise is drastically reduced. Can't fault it.Build quality/comfort: These took a little getting used to for me, but once you find what is most comfortable for your head they are easily wearable for long periods of time. I have worn these for 4 hours straight today with no discomfort/ear sweat. The cups are big enough to fit around the whole ear without crushing them, however it can get a bit warm (not to the point when you will NEED to take them off). Build quality is great, the headband and cups are very soft and the touch controls work very well once you get used to the positioning.I once never thought I would spend this much on a pair of headphones, but I have absolutely no regrets with these.", "I have had the Sony WH-1000XM2 previously, so here are the key differences with the Sony WH-1000XM3 (third model):* XM3 model is much lighter (XM2 could become heavy after a while, and would give me tension headaches) and more comfortable (better padding, bigger ear pads)* Less gap between head and headphones, looks better while being worn* I do like the new look with copper highlights/branding* Carry case now has space for the 3.5mm audio cable, the (very short) charging USB-C cable and the plane adapter* Headphones can be used now without music, just on noise cancelling (no active bluetooth connection). MX2 would switch off automatically* When not playing music, the white noise/hiss produced by the Active Noise Cancelling is a lot less pronounced (so much better at just being used for silence)* Noise cancelling still works very well. Is it better? Probably slighly. Would cancel noise of kids playing on the street, a radio playing music, a spinning washing machine, noisy neighbors etc.* Sound quality is still great. Is it better? I was already very happy with the MX2 to be honest, particularly when playing music via the LDAC codec built in Android phones* When pressing the power button once, the voice now says the actual battery level in percentage, as opposed to just low/medium/highOverall, a great upgrade from the XM2 model, and probably top of the class now in term of bluetooth headphones with active noise cancelling.If only Sony could just allow for multiple bluetooth sources to be connected at the same time (via firmware update?), and also for the touch control to be disabled/locked (e.g. when sleeping), those headphones would just be perfect!They are expensive, but I think Active Noise Cancelling only really works on high end models, due to processing power required.", "The downside: The quality control of this model seems to be way lower than I would expect for this price. I\u2019ve had and returned two of these now. I know a couple of friends who\u2019ve had similar issues.That said, after a couple of returns, I got a good set and they are great! They make commuting in London a lot more chill as they sort of remove most of the hustle and bustle and just leave you in a bubble with your music.As I\u2019m sure a lot of other reviews have said, they don\u2019t remove screetching hogher frequencies like bad track on the tube, but if you\u2019re on a train with a good section it\u2019s amazing how quiet everything is.And the sound quality is really very nice. It\u2019s a shame that so few devices will use Sonys high quality LDAC, as the AAC on iOS is good but not great. If you do need extra clarity and beautiful sound quality, listening with the cord attached and uncompressed music like FLACs does yield an improvement.That said, they are very pleasant to listen to wirelessly. I also have a high quality set of in ears, which reduce outside sound a ton - and these compliment them well for days when I have ear fatigue from too much deep in ear time. The quality of isolation from the two is different. The in ears dampen treble more than bass, and these dampen bass more than treble. I\u2019d love a solution that managed both. But what these do is you can set the level of ambient sound coming in. In ears, I keed to pull them out every time which can get annoying.Below is my old review before I got the good pair.The first had AMAZING noise cancelling, but the mic wouldn\u2019t work for phonecalls. The second pair had working microphones for voice calls, but the noise cancelling was only roughly half as good, and the train sound was really very annoyingly loud. Luckily the third set had no issues. I imagine it was from a new run as it came preloaded with firmware 2.0, whereas the buggier two early examples I returned both shipped with Version 1.0 and I updated.", "The sound is wonderful, the noise cancelling magical, the headphones comfortable.So why one star?Because the quality of the microphone and / the digital processing of the voice makes them unusable for phone calls.And if they are unusable for phone calls, then they are unusable period.When a phone call came in, i had to plug in my \u00a36.99 wired generic headphones to have a conversation.After paying \u00a3329... ridiculous.Sent back for a refund.Sad really, Sony achieved the  hard challenge (sound quality &amp; NC)  but failed on the easy part. (Simple phone conversation)", "I had a pair of Bose 35s which I have 'passed on to' my brother as a pre-xmas gift. After reading the reviews decided to plunge, I have to say vs the Bose 35s these nail it totally. The bass is tighter and more extended, the sound stage better with all sounds being very well de-marked and not spoiling the vocals, the Bose I found at times with my personal preference of Rock music can get to be a bit of a mashed up mess especially if there are a lot of guitars.  Listening to Shine on you crazy diamond this morning was just bliss and having spent the last 2 yrs using the Bose35s I can definitely say these come out on top.The noise cancelling is different class vs the Bose almost to the point of when commuting you have to be very aware as you  just cannot pick out outside sounds period when music is on. The touch controls were a bit fiddly to start with but once you get used to it it works well. Finally i do like, even though the action itself is kinda wrong, to mute the sound and noise cancelling cup the right ear with you hand and you hear train announcements or people talking to you  etc which was a nice touch.The battery  is strong had well over 25hrs first useage and I find the comfort level of the phones nice, wore them for 2hrs this morning and didn't even get hot ears! which is a first for wireless phones.North of \u00a3300 is a lot to pay for a set of headphones but like many reviews these are the best around this price point IMO and I can compare them to their nearest  rival the Bose35, I certainly rate the Sony's higher, I do think though like HIFI once you start spending serious money the end product gets to be Subjective.", "Well, simply put, these are some bloody good headphones. Seriously, even at a price of \u00a3329.99, it's an investment worth making. The noise cancellation on these is excellent. The outside world? What the hell is an outside world? It seriously elimates so much. People in the same room as you are audible but they are massively quiet. Sound of the kettle boiling? Gone. Washing machine? Gone.And that's not to mention the sound quality. Now these haven't been designed to be competing against the marketed headphones of the Sennheiser 500/600 series, Fidelio X2, H4 and the like. But they sounds great still. Soundstage is decent, with a tendency to be V-Shaped, but with the fantastic Sony Connect equaliser, you can fix this easily. And LDAC support as well for Android 8.0, great. Even DSEE HX works great for the most part, filling in data and doing a decent job.The phones have got NFC, so pairing with your phone is a case of activating Bluetooth, loading the app and placing the phone next to the phones and hey presto, you're in. Make sure you allow the app to configure the ANC to your headphone placement as well with the quick config tool.These might be the best headphones purchase I've made. Great battery life, good sound quality with EQ fixes, amazing ANC, and an investment for years.", "I've been using these headphones daily for remote conference calls, music and gaming for two months. The noise cancelling is the best I've ever experienced and the sound is good too. However the bluetooth rarely connects first time, resulting in annoying power cycles. One of my colleagues has the same headphones and gets similar issues. Even more annoying is that the headphones have recently started refusing to power on. I tried charging from an adapter instead of my laptop and using a different cable, but still nothing. I had to follow Sony's technical help to perform a factory reset to get them working again. The problem has reoccured twice since. Time for a return :(Well I returned and received a replacement pair and a completely new set of glitches. Amazon Alexa integration doesn't work at all, but more importantly when using bluetooth on video conference calls the other members get lots of interference. It went away when I stopped using bluetooth and plugged in the cable. Returning for the 2nd time. Response from Sony Technical support to the Alexa issue was useless see below. Downgrading my review accordingly&gt;&gt; I have installed the latest firmware, registered the headphones with the alexa app on my iPhone XR, confirmed the NC/Ambient noise button activates Alexa, but cannot get Alexa voice asset to work. When I press the NC/Ambient noise button on the headphones I hear a first high pitch immediately followed by a second low pitch. I suspect the assistant being activated and cancelled immediately.&gt; Thank you for contacting Sony support.We are sorry to learn that you are unable to use Alexa speaker with your Sony headphone.We would like to highlight that Alexa speaker is currently compatible with Sony TVs only.Moreover, we can confirm that the Iphone XR isn\u2019t a compatible device.Should you have any further questions, please feel free to reply to this e-mail.Thank you for your enquiry.", "Sound Quality and noise cancellation is great but the creaking plastic kills the experience. It creaks when you put them on and creaks moving your head or face. When they are on the creaky plastic sound is really loud going through your head. Make the entire experience feel cheap. in comparison the Bose Quiet Comfort II feel so much more premium and solid.", "Check the reviews. All true! This is a fantastic pair of headphones! Worth every penny.I tested these headphones at the airport when I had time to kill. It was shocking how good noise cancellation they have! I felt like somebody switched off all the noise around me! I had to take them off to check if my hearing is still alright. It is fantastic!I was hunting for these here and around other retails shops and it was always out of stock in 2018 November. Finally I was lucky enough and I could order them from Amazon.Boy, these are amazing.Some audiophiles found these bass heavy. I love it. I listen pop and electronic music and it sounds perfect. It is not a head massager bumm bumm machine but all the sound so clear. No background noise, so I no need to listen on the max volume to isolate myself. I tested it with so much music instantly - I even re subscribe for Spotify to feed my head with music via my new favorite headphones.At home have 3 working computers with way too many hard drives and fans. Now the white noise disappeared. Also the neighbour's kids screeming over the wall. And the shouting parents because the kids screaning. All gone. Peace!It was also funny to make a cup of tea when I was wearing these. No any noise from the cattle and can't hear the spoon when it lands in the empty cup. Magic.I can't recommend enough.Edit after 2 weeks: The call quality not so good. The other party told me my voice soinds like if I am speaking from a great distance. Not a deal breaker but I expected crystal clear voice calls if we already have 10 microphones around my head...The other challange for the headphones is the wind. It really tricks the noise cancelling system.The touch control function needs time to prectice. I am still struggling with the paly/pause double touch control and sometimes I jump to the next track, instead of rising the volume. I think I would be happier with physical buttons what I can find with a gentle touch and no need to scratching my headphone with a hope if I do it right.Still no regret. The noise cancellation is the best.", "As part of my job, I've reviewed all of the flagship ANC headphones, and Sony were the previous leaders with their WH-1000X M2. This new M3 model, takes all of the fantastic features from last year's model, pushes them even further and also introduces a lot of new changes to make them even better. In a lot of cases, the new improvements specifically address the faults of the M2s.My full review for these headphones is on YouTube, just search for 'InsideTech', but for now, the pros and cons are listed below:Pros:- Class leading battery and fast charging (10 min charge = 5 hours playback)- Class-leading active noise cancelling (the M2 model already had the best ANC, but with the new, more powerful QN1 chip, these M3s are now even better, particularly for voices/higher frequencies - something that most ANC headphones struggle with).- QN1 chip dedicates more power to audio, soundstage feels wider, mid-range more balanced and bass slightly heavier (vs M2 model)- USB-C charging (future-proofed, no more micro USB)- Fantastic build quality: premium materials, beautiful graphite finish with copper accents (new, more durable headband)- New earcups: softer, thicker padding, ergonomic shape, more spacious/deeper, better breathability, new smooth finish for touch panel (incidentally the touch controls are fantastic), redesigned, raised buttons (easier to press)- Headband has thicker padding for increased comfort- 3-mic array on earcups (better ANC, better phone calls)- Lighter than M2s by 20 g (more in line with other flagship headphones), great for long-time wear- Fantastic bluetooth connection, almost zero latency (great for videos)- Most technologically advanced ANC headphones out there: adaptive sound control, atmospheric optimiser, 'quick attention' feature (the most useful and functional feature on any ANC headphones), plus many moreCons:- Comfort is improved massively, but still not as good as Bose QC35 II- No Bluetooth 5.0- USB-C is only for charging, not audio (doesn't exploit versatility of USB-C)- No multi-device pairing! (inconvenient to unpair/re-pair to each device when you want to switch)Overall, these are a phenomenal pair of wireless headphones - the best that money can buy (which is why they cost \u00a3329). Does this price justify the features? Yes. Are they for the average consumer? Probably not. We're talking about the best of the best here - you've really got to be into your audio to purchase these (but if you do, you won't be disappointed). If the previous generation (M2) are available for \u00a3100 or more cheaper, go for them instead. Otherwise, the new features justify the upgrade.", "The title says it all unfortunately.The Good:Received the headphones recently and the audio quality is generally good, the companion app features work including adjusting noise cancellation to your environment. Battery life has been great.The Ugly (and dealbreaker for an expensive headset) :On the use of calling apps for smartphones and computersThis unit supports normal incoming calls only. Calling apps for smartphones and computers are not supported", "Of all my reviews, this is the one that makes me the saddest.  I'm currently on my way to returning this item. I wanted to love this product so much, but unfortunately the touch controls are just far too unreliable. I've heard of the cold weather problem but this has nothing to do with that - I live in Bristol and London and neither city is that cold, even in the peak of winter. It should not be the case that you pay an absolute premium for this item and you end up with one of the core functions being basically unusable.Pros:I love the sound, the noise cancellation and the comfort over long hours of usage. Build quality is good, love the fact that it has USB C. I don't detect any latency when watching videos. Battery life is amazing and charge times are ridiculously fast. The app is quite stacked with features.ConsThe touch controls are middling and there's no multi-connectivity support. These headphones have many \"nice-to-have\" features but which I don't need - I don't need a super long battery life, I don't need super fast charge times, I don't need a stacked app as I don't play around with any of the features anyway. I just need the core fundamentals to be solid, which means I'll be changing to the QC35ii.", "let\u2019s start by saying that the headphones are the best noise cancelling. pack with features comfortable fit beautiful case but I\u2019m sorry to say I had to send the headphones back for three reasons that they didn\u2019t suit me personally.1. I wanted to use the headphones for the noise cancelling because I commute on the bus twice a day this is my first problem I had with the noise cancelling. As the bus was going along the noise cancelling was cutting out all the noise around me but every time the bus went over a bump in the road all there was a lot of vibration. it was picked up by the noise counselling by cutting out the music. the microphones was having trouble isolating loud shocks or bumps from the bus. I\u2019ve checked the app to see what Setting it was at and it was on commuting so I knew it was on the right setting for travelling on the bus.2. As the headphones have great features the problem I seem to found the features only work when the app was opening on your device.So when you use the headphones you have to remember to open up the app every time you want to use them.3. This is the biggest problem I had with the headphones with voice calling every time you answer a phone call the mic would open up the environment around you in the caller could not hear you only the outside noise around you and this was a big major problem for me travelling on the bus", "I'll spare the details as you've probably researched these to death already. Ultimately most people will want to know whether these are better than the Bose Qc35's or not.In my opinion, the answer is unequivocally \"Yes!\". The Bose are beaten in terms of sound quality, noise cancelling, build quality, features, accompanying app and looks.The Bose may be a tad more comfy (really marginally) with a little more room in the ear cup and a little less imposing on you skull but that's all they have going for them over the Sony's. Oh, well I guess I'll give them the edge for the carry case too.Winner = Sony!", "The product is well built and feature rich. I bought it after buying the latest Bose 35's for comparison. The first tell tale sign that they weren't that good sonically is that they come with an sound equaliser app for your phone. The first thing you need to do is boast the treble...Even with this back to back listening showed they weren't even close to the Bose. I'm an audiophile so I am probably more picky then most... but there was a huge difference. The base and mid-range simply lacked definition in comparison, and the artificially amplified treble still meant that vocals weren't as clear and as distinct. For an audiophile the difference when listening back to back was huge, and I made my mind to send them back in about 10 minutes...If you are less fussy about sound, then they are feature packed. I liked the gestures you can use on the headphone can, nice feature. The app was really nice too. It has a lot more features than the Bose and if features are important to you than they might be the choice for you.I've read several reviews that talk about the fit... and it's true they just don't feel as nice on as the Bose. I think they are heavier and they feel hotter on your ears. Not sure why. Then their is the look. They arguably look better than the Bose.They do noise cancellation just as good as the Bose also.But for me, sound is everything, so sending them back was a no brainer.", "Not impressed,Staging not goodSound muffled", "Product is very good. The sound is excellent and the functions are pretty good. Some issues with the apps some times but well, Developers are developers, can't blame the headphones!  Also can't adjust the sound options when you choose the \"Highest\" quality sound rate; something that sony should work on, as it's really a downside to the product's capabilities. I haven't tried to pair two devices yet, so I'm not sure if one can be set for Music and the other for receiving calls etc.Amazon on the other hand just failed on this product. Sony advises to ask extended warranty from the retailer, in this case Amazon, which doesn't offer any extended warranty!! amazing.  Also the Amazon extended cover for headphones is not valid if you purchase it separately and Amazon's site doesn't provide this as an option at the time of purchase, you have to actually target your search to \"Waranty\" to find that option. How am I supposed to know that this cover exist Amazon? And why not give the option to purchase separately? Is it so hard for your underwriting company to actually start the warranty from the day of the product delivery no matter when you buy the Cover?  I'm thinking to return the product and buy elsewhere just for this, as it is an expensive product and with only 1 year of warranty on it.", "The noise cancelling is great and the sound is great, but these headphones are massively let down by the touchpad / gesture controls.It's really easy to accidentally skip to the next track when you're trying to turn up the volume, and I'm always doing stuff on the touchpad by accident. I scratch my head and suddenly I'm listening to a different song. I put the headphones down on the wrong kind of surface and hear lots of beeping and don't know what's going on.I'd much rather have normal buttons that you can feel without performing random actions.\u00a3300 headphones should not have this problem.Edit: revised from 2 stars to 1 star \u2014 I figured I might get used to dealing with the insane touch controls, but they've only become more annoying over time. They're a daily frustration.Also, I've had \u00a340 headphones that properly support connecting multiple audio sources. It is hard to believe that Sony doesn't know how to do this when there are cheap Chinese knockoff \"brands\" that do.", "After few times using,  there is a serious problem discovered. I found cracking noise appear when the noise cancelling is on especially on a fast moving train, but if I turn off the noise cancelling, the cracking noise will stop.I emailed this problem to Sony, and they replied \"...Please note that in tunnels and other environments in which air pressure changes easily, noise (creaking, clicking, static, etc.) may be heard.If this happens, temporarily turn off the noise cancelling function during use.\"No, I am not in tunnels or other environments which air pressure changes easily! This morning, I just sat on my office chair with my headphone, after 30 mins later, it start creaking when I moving my head. And I tried to wear it while I am running, it start creaking.I am buying this expensive headphone I expect I can wear it on the train or doing exercise, once it start making creaking noise which  is super irritating. Of course, I tried turn off the noise cancelling function when this happened in a train, but this is NOT the solution because if I turn the noise cancelling on again, it will making creaking noise again! This make this headphone useless because I am buying it and paying it for its noise cancelling function but you ask me to turn that off!Also, I found many customer have the same problem with me, this is a production problem! Please Google \"WH-1000XM3 Cracking/popping noise\"Because it has over Amazon's return times, I am now asking Sony send me a replacement, but still waiting their reply! Very disappoint for such high price headphone!", "Connection problems, will not reconnect to last connected device, have to manually manage. Too much bass emphasis, lacking in treble detail and the earphone leather squeaks and creaks..!! Noise cancellation is excellent but not useful enough to warrant living with the aforementioned problems.", "Very unimpressive for the cost. Not  significantly better  at noise cancelling than  models a tenth the price.  Kept shutting itself down for no reason.  I sent it back.", "This is not a full review as there are far some very good reviews already here. I agree with all the good stuff.One improvement over the MX2s is that reporting the battery life now gives an approximate percentage left so, instead of;Battery level: MediumThe MX3s will say:Battery level: about 80%I find this a lot more useful.", "Plenty of reviews with the positive aspects so I'll just list the reasons of why I returned these headphones, in order of importance to me.- earpads felt very cheap and of poor quality. They also made a slight yet audible rustling sound when I moved my head.I did look to replace the earpads with better quality ones but this didn't seem reasonably feasible (sony's ear-pad connections).- very annoying voice telling me at what stage the noise cancellation was at every time I pressed the NC button..very intrusive...just give be a little beep, for beeps sake!- sound quality wasn't as impressive as the various reviews led me to believe.- headband need fairly frequent correcting to keep headphones in positions.Otherwise, these headphones are great. Just not for me.", "At first i was amazed and very happy for two months, but then i realised that there is a big issue. Every time im in the bus/train/car or anywhere shakey there is a really annoying crisping sound coming from the noise cancelling system. When i turn it off it's fine but otherwise it's there and there is nothing to do about it. It's too late for me to return the item so i feel bad for spending the money for something like this.Recently they made a software upgrade and it's much better, however if i am making a phone call in the bus and the road is bad and i am shakey, the person on the other side can barely hear me (which in not the case with regular earphones with mic).I will give them 4 stars because they work great otherwise i am just a bit disappointed still", "My sennheiser RS180 headphones recently developed a fault so it was time for an upgrade.  I purchased a BT transmitter for use with my PC and decided to pair it with the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones.  Note: I am using the 3.5mm jack connection from my custom upgraded Asus STX soundcard to the BT transmitter.  Initially I thought the Sony headphones sounded pretty good whilst listening to some music tracks.  The bass was on the heavy side but mid and treble sounded ok.  Noise cancelling works extremely well and really does cut out most ambient noise.  Design of ear cups meant my ears got pretty hot after about 2 hours of usage.  It all started to go downhill when I fired up a few games BF1 &amp; BF5 most notably.  The sound stage was weak with the bass overpowering and the mid range pretty non-existent.  I gave it a chance for an hour or so but just couldn't get the sound balanced (even tweaking the EQ settings in the sound card control panel).  I then paired my Bose on-ear headphones to the same BT transmitter and what a difference, the sound was immediately more balanced across the range with a large amount more detail in the mid-high range.  I kept swapping the headphones over between rounds of BF5 for comparison and the Sony headphones were poor to say the least.  I then went back to listen to some music tracks and the same lacking mid-high range was noticeable in comparison to the Bose.  I've had them a grand total of 7 hours and they have just been dropped off at the parcel point for return.", "As a tech enthusiast and someone who has worked with/for all the big brands from Apple to Samsung to Sony this was going to be a challenge for me. I was born into a musical family and frequented studios throughout my childhood. Music is exquistely important to me from movie Soundtracks to hip-hop and faster tempo genres or really chilled out and ambient sounds. So you can imagine that the recent obsessions with Noice Cancelling is Very off-putting when im more concerned about THE SOUND &amp; Volume quality &amp; delivery.Bose headphones deliver Great quality but Lack Seriously in the Volume department - there isn't a chance in Hell i would invest my money in a pair of headphones more focussed on Cancelling sound than actually Producing it. I feel that Beats (Apple Gen) are Very underrated but i can understand why given previous years of reputation - That being said, they need to catch back up imo for \"Reliability\" marks. Sound-wise I think they're much better than previous years tho. However.......Ladies and Gentleman - Sony are BACK with the XM3s. The sound quality is Great - Seriously! And with the EQ sertings in the 'headphones' app - my LORD you can adjust the track to sound how You want it (believe me it makes a great difference and is Well worth it for your particular favourite tracks). The volume (with NC on) is Much better than the bose (imo) and by a Long shot too. NC is something more for travellers to review though so I'll keep that review short. I will say as someone who isnt Massive on NC but still appreciates it - There is Good reason in this NC why Sony knocked Bose off the top spot with these XM3s.The bass wasnt even something i really needed to question but I can assure you they deliver Most of the time (unless said track is *Really heavy on the bass or has multiple bass lines)The carry case is ok, dunno why they built it so you have to twiss up the headphones to insert them, and a carry handle would be handy too but its good and Does the job of protecting my investment.The app is pretty brilliant and gives you more options for ambient sound, EQ settings, Current track playing and More! But above all it is clean and easy to use.Get More than a full day's use from the battery (No problem). Discreet, clean build and design.Before tryong them this last week, I was Considering buying another pair of headphones later down the line that might make up Volume or Bass differences but Im so happy with these, there's honestly no need.Pro tip - DO YOUR RESEARCH. Your ears are exactly that - YOURS. Try different pairs where you can cycle through Your personal music selections so you can get an idea of how Your ears process the sound being delievered. i tried these several times in various PC world/Curry's and John Lewis stores before i committed to purchasing here.", "I think this is mostly a case of something being impossibly hyped. I had a cheap \u00a335 pair of TaoTronics in-ear noise-cancelling 'phones. They were very good, but a bit uncomfortable and the cable was a pain. The NC was decent. It helped on the train, but didn't block out colleagues or the radio.I'd read a lot about these and how amazing they're meant to be, totally blocking out all noise. But they're EXPENSIVE!But when Amazon offered my 6-months interest free on these, it lessened the immediate blow and I took a chance.Humph. They're, umm, okay. They feel pretty premium, the ear pads are lovely. The bluetooth works well on my phone and my laptop. But the NC? Honestly, it's barely better than the TaoTronics. Sometimes I think it's actually worse.  I'll keep these, because the wireless freedom really is lovely. But don't buy these expecting the NC to change your world. It won't.", "These headphones are great.  The touch control and ambient sound features make it stand out as a 21st century set of headphones.They are however let down by terrible Bluetooth connectivity:1. You cannot connect to multiple devices at the same time like with the Bose.  You could forgive most for this but at approx \u00a3270, you feel a little short changed.2. Switching to different devices:a. You cannot switch to different devices from the headphones. Again for \u00a3270..b. The deal breaker.  You cannot connect to the headphones if they are already connected to another device. All headphones including cheapies can do this.  If you connect from another paired device, it should disconnect the other, but no, you have to find which device it's connected to and manually disconnect it.  This is poor. A failure in product leadership.2. Comfort.  Not as good as it could be.  Even for my flat ears, as there's no depth inside the ear pad, your ears are always touching the inner foam, which makes my ears itch from the sweat.It's a shame, these could have been easily the best, but it's hard to not want to continue with Bose QC II on a daily basis as even though they do not have the fancy features, they totally nail the basics - which Sony fail on.", "The hardware is amazing. They're comfortable, light (people complain they feel cheap, I don't understand this, so long as it doesn't break I prefer it light), the ANC is the best in the market and the sound quality is good for anc/wireless. However, the software on it drives me nuts:- Every operation on the headphones has a NON-OPTIONAL voice telling you what's happening: \"Power on!\", \"Bluetooth connected!\", \"Power off!\", \"Noise cancelling!\" and so on. This is great for about 10 minutes, then it just gets on the way. Between the voices and the rather long long-press required for power on, you're looking at 10 seconds between putting the headphones and music flowing.- The touch controls are great when you're on the street, but totally get on the way when I'm at home. Want to watch a movie while laying in bed with your arms crossed behind your head? Too bad, your right bicep will trigger the \"quick listen\" mode. Want to take your headphones out for a sec with your right hand? Ha, most likely you triggered 3 gestures. Again, you can't disable those!- The headphones default to a rather V shaped equaliser, where the bass is going to overwhelm the mid range. I understand the choice as it seems most people want bass heavy headhones, however, the only way to change that is to switch the Bluetooth codec to SBT for some obscure reason. So, if you want a flat headphone AND high quality streaming, you can't.- The headphones say they'll power off after 5 minutes of inactivity. However, this doesn't mean what you think it means. It means 5 minutes of no Bluetooth connection! Android won't turn off the Bluetooth connection from inactivity ever, so basically if you put these on the table and walk away, the battery will be drained by tomorrow.- The battery charge level is completely bogus. The headphones reported battery low, I quick charged them for 15 minutes and it said battery level high. However, after 20 minutes of usage, it was on battery low again! Now, after a proper full 3h charge it has been lasting for a long time so the battery is fine, it just can't seem to infer charge level on a lithium battery somehow.- The cable jack is not very tight, so it's easy to have the cable unplug accidentally with a sudden head movement if it gets stuck somewhere (inside coat, chair at work..). Now, this wouldn't be that big a of a deal if it wasn't because immediately... \"power off!\".I hope a future firmware upgrade will fix all of these, but until then it's 2 starts from me.", "Look man, I very rarely write a review, but with the atrocity that are these headphones I felt like I had to.I've had these headphones for about 4 months now (I used to have the Bose QC 35s which are excellent btw)- Volume randomly changes when the headphones are turned off and on (I live in the UK, and the weather the past few months has been fine)- There are random popping noises from the headphones- The structure of the headphones is so poor I can hear the frame creak when I\u2019m walking with them on - Can only connect to one device at the same time through Bluetooth- The Bluetooth connects and disconnects randomly FOR NO REASON- Bluetooth interference is really bad, with the Bose I had no problem, with these if I go to a crowd of 5 people the headphones basically make zero sound and just jitter.The fact that there is a \u2018phantom touch\u2019 issue in cold weather shows you how much testing the guys at Sony did. I guess this is what happens when the engineers are not listened to and the sales guys want to start making money.For something that costs \u00a3300+ the quality is atrocious.", "been using these for over a year now. here are my thoughts:(1) travelling -- these headphones are a damned life saver on a plane. Not only do I get to actually hear the film or music I'm listening to, but I don't get off the plane with hearing that doesn't recover for a few hours. It's totally comfortable to wear them on 11+ hour flights. the USB-c support means I can charge them on my laptop, phone or nintendo switch charger. I can even use my laptop as a backup battery for them using a double-ended usb-c cable.(2) exercise -- these headphones are NOT designed to be used for exercise, and not water or sweat proofed. However, I've found they work just fine in light rain and when I work out. It's great to be able to cancel out the noise around both figuratively and literally at the gym(3) taking meetings -- I had the WH100XM2s and the bose QC30s, these seem to be the best of all of these. Even in fairly windy conditions I have never gotten a complaint about wind noise. With ambient sound off, you can hear yourself pretty OK. Always a joy to be able to walk around the house when taking meetings.(4) Listening to music -- these have really good audio reproduction. For fear of getting executed by the headphone mob, the quality approaches my dt770 pros, when the Bose QCs were a clear and straight downgrade.(5) Gaming -- it's highly unfortunate, but like most bluetooth headphones out there these headphones may support AptX, but they do *not* support AptX Low Latency. That makes these only a fair choice for gaming. You can use the included cable which has no latency instead but it kinda voids the point of being wireless of course, and the cable is quite short -- I often catch it on my arm and get a huge *BANG* in my left ear as I accidentally unplug it.(6) Recording, monitoring and streaming -- I've used a mic setup with a loopback for years with a good quality mic. It's something I couldn't really go without. The delay on these headphones in AptX mode is I'd say a good quarter of a second. It's essentially impossible to use them to hear yourself talk from some external device. As mentioned previously this can be helped with the included cable, but it's highly inconvenient to say the least.(7) (open) Office work -- these will block everything out and that's a double edged sword. Not being able to even hear yourself breathe tends to feel a bit claustraphobic, even with ambient audio on. This is great for those times you want to take yourself out of a space and focus on something, but I start to feel uncomfortable after a while from the silence and / or the metallic sounding filtering the ambient audio goes through. Possibly could be fixed by tweaking the noise cancelling as you can do in the mobile app.Bugs and Issues(1) I went through quite a bit of frustration where the mic would cut out completely until I disconnected and reconnected to the call I was taking. This seems to be an issue with the way the headphones's software handles bluetooth connections. If you have multiple bluetooth pairings, walking into range of another can temporarily disable mic connectionSuggestions(1) add AptX Low Latency support. Since you can get zero latency with the included cable, this is entirely a software thing. That would let me use these for everything I do, travelling gaming and all(2) I'd really like to be able to rename my headphones to make them less confusing to pair sometimes(3) Let me use the app to prioritize devices. It can be really annoying to get these headphones to connect to the right thing when I turn them on, since they just connect to the strongest signal that gets to them first, which unless I manually disable bluetooth will always be my desktop or laptop. If I want to connect my phone as I leave home, I either have to walk out of range or mash the connection button on my phone to ensure they connect first as the headphones turn on(4) add some tactile feedback to the swipe actions on the side of the headphones. The swipe actions have very strict feeling directionality, I find myself using the edge of the headphones to help ensure I swipe properly. some kind of little recess would help me gesture much more easily(5) to pair these headphones, you have to hold the power button for a whopping seven seconds, and it gets very confusing because during those seven seconds it still performs the power button action. Would be great if I could press both buttons for half the time(6) Improve the UX around having an AUX cable connected. presently, the cable can be connected with the headphones on or off, but turning them off requires connecting the cable first. If I'm using them at my desk for a long time, I sometimes want to be able to power them off to go out for the night or something and I'll often find they're still on, but totally out of battery(7) the headphones are able to detect some types of calls and enable a loopback mode that makes speaking much clearer. It would be great to be able to toggle this on when I'm using my desktop computer", "Out the box - followed the documented charging regime, no charge.Searched online and discovered this is a common fault which has been reported for many months from many purchasers.Not going to waste my time grumbling and troubleshooting, these are going straight back for a replacement.", "So I bought these back in January and absolutely loved them. The sound quality is amazing, clear sounds and deep punchy bass without affecting the trebles, the design and feel of them is great. Everything worked perfectly. At the time i would've rated them 5 stars.HOWEVER, after a few months use some issues started to occur and after searching online, apparently the is happening to many others..The problems are:1)The touchpad not responding all of a sudden.2)Even without swiping the touch pad, music starts/stops, skips, as if it's constantly being swiped which, when it happens, makes the headphones completely unusable.3)Bluetooth disconnects and then connects every now and then.This didn't happen as often at the start, but now it's become VERY frequent, I actually regret spending so much money and purchasing these headphones. Which is the reason why after months of usage, Im rating these headphones 1 star.If you get a pair of these headphones which have no issues at all, you will not regret it and you'll most likely love them. However, I regret this purchase..", "I already own a pair of B&amp;Ws groundbreaking PX, and my wife has the 1000X-M2s which are beautiful. So I got a bit jealous, and justified this purchase on the fact we are going on a 10 hour flight in March.I love my PX, they are an audiophiles dream and get better the more you use them. They are also beautiful and packed with features, so the Sony\u2019s had a lot to live up to.And they do.First off, they weigh nothing. Honestly, it\u2019s insane. All of that technology and the best noise cancelling in the world, and it just doesn\u2019t weigh anything. How??!Secondly, they talk about the \u201csilhouette\u201d a lot in their speil, but it really is true. They sit tight to the shape of your head whilst remaining comfortable, avoiding that something about Mary earmuffs look that always worries me when I\u2019m wearing over ears.Talking of comfort, the lightness and the padding makes for a great wear. They don\u2019t push too hard on your head and you can easily wear them for hours.Features wise, the gesture control and cupping one ear to let sound in is really good and works every time. The addition of Alexa is good if you like that sort of thing too.One thing missing is that they don\u2019t detect when you are wearing them to allow them to automatically turn on and connect to your device like the PXs do, but I reckon I can muster the energy to press a button.The noise cancelling takes your breath away. There\u2019s nothing like it.Features like voice focus, virtual surround and altitude detection take this product well above and beyond anything else on the market.Sure, the PX have them on sound quality (just) and beauty, but if you want the best headphones in the price range and above, these are easily the winners.Bye bye Bose", "No doubt these headphones would be great if you could work out how to set them up. I installed the app and spent three hours trying to get them to work. Gave up! Couldn\u2019t get them to connect or work at all. Far too complicated. Returned them for refund.", "I had to write this review as I spent so much time deliberating and testing these against the Jabra offering. I had already ruled out the Bose QC' as they are older technology and other then NC they lacked features of the newer Sony's and Jabra. I had to return the first pair of these as the BT kept dropping out (tired on several devices) second set are spot on. I am a big music fan and like sound to be as good as it can babe within my budget. Lets face it, these are not cheap and I can't justify the spend by saying I am a frequent air traveller because I am not. My aim was to get the best ANC headphones combined with the best sound quality, these are to be used in the (noisy) office, train, out and about and at home when the kids are watching one of their movies.Noise Cancelling - Wow, as soon as they are switched on, the ANC kicks in and pretty much puts you in a world of your own, its freaky but comfortable, no weird feelings of pressure change, they just work. GreatSound Quality - Superb, there are a few shared playlists on most streaming services there people have shared their 'Headphones Testing Playlists' definitely worth a listen when testing new headphones and these playlists usually contain some tracks designed for headphones and to hear them on a good set is quite amazing. These do not disappoint.Comfort - Lightweight, no stress on my head (and I wear glasses) and for me, the most comfortable headphones I have ever used (and I have gone through many, many sets over the years)Niggles - Yes, of course. You can only connect to one active device at a time, (the Jabra's allowed two connections) meaning if I want to change from my phone to my MacBook, I have to disconnect from one then connect to the other, this may not sound like much hassle but once you have used a set that can connect to 2 devices simultaneously, you will notice the different (especially if you move from devices a lot). Second niggle, the auto power off is based on BT connectivity, not actual use. Meaning, if I take the headphones off to stop using them, but the device they are connected to is still in range (and it always is within the house or office) they won't power off (other headphones I have turn off after a period of inactivity), this caught me out a few times so now I have to make the conscious decision to power them down each time I finish using them. Third and final niggle is that the Sony App isn't fully compatible with iOS13/13.1/13.2 some features simply don't work. No sign of a firmware update as yet.Features - Excellent, although these are not a newly released headphone, they are jam packed with features. The touch controls are very good, just the right sensitivity and each to get used to. The ANC levels are also superb as you can vary via the app. The codes supported covers the entire range of possibilities. Finally, despite the problems with iOS13, the app is very good. You get a very good equaliser, ANC control and access to other settings.Compared to the Jabra? - Difficult, the Jabra sound better to me and they do have some positives that best the Sony's but the ANC isn't as good (lets face it nothing from any brand is at this moment in time). I done a big comparison between the two and the Jabra faired very favourably but in the end I opted for these and I am glad I did.Hope this helps someone looking to buy these - Cheap they are not but quality they most certainly are.If you found this useful, please tick the little thumbs up - Thank you.", "The sound quality is very good, and the noise-cancellation is indeed great (on par with Bose).The product though is absolutely *NOT recommended*, after using it for about 2 monthsThe call quality is horrible for such a high-end headset. And I mean actually impossible to talk.For some reason the microphones start pumping surrounding noise to your ears, the moment you enter \"call mode\" (normal phone call or any calling app or recording - tested on 3 android phones, an iPhone, and a Macbook Pro). And I don't mean just that the noise-cancellation switches off, or that you hear an occasional sound. I mean that literally, the microphones take ALL noise from the environment and amplify it to your ears, like they do in \"ambient sound\" mode. This means that if you are on the street, amplified motorbike sound is passed to your ears over your fellow-callers voice. If you are in the office, keyboard strokes or chat from the next-door office are amplified, so that you can hear them (even if they were inaudible just by having the headphones on).However, this is not a deal-breaker unless you use the mainly for calling.What is a deal-breaker for me, is that I have been trying to reach the customer support for the past month. I have emailed them, intially they seemed very helpful. I have been waiting for their call ever since. Every day I get a \"template\" email, asking me for a 2h slot for the next day, I provide it, and the next day I get an apology and another email asking for the same. This has been going on for about 2-3 weeks now, with literally daily emails, horrible customer support. A lot of anger and annoyance for an otherwise good product. I have talked to Seif and Haisham at their customer service, but it seems that it's the policy of Sony to provide such a horrible after-sales service.My intention was to discuss with them, mention the bug, see if my unit is faulty and maybe replace it, or suggest a fix. However, after this experience I will return the headset as soon as possible and go for the Bose QC35II which I have tested since then and, even though the sound is slightly worse, it's much better designed in terms of functionality.In short, it is a good product overall, but there is an unacceptable bug in calling-mode, and their customer service is the worst I have ever experienced, probably worse that going to a random electronics store.", "I can\u2019t say I dislike anything.I bought these because I have autism and travelling, being outside and having a general day at college is a huge task. I never realised how much of my energy is drained by my surroundings. These headphones have honestly given me a new quality of life, I was so happy. Even without playing music the noise cancelling is extremely effective. But can be decreased by wearing hats which is the downside.I wish there was a noise cancelling feature which allowed voice focus as the ambient option is still too distracting. But it does the job.And with music, say goodbye to the world! The sound quality is really good, I also use it when I\u2019m playing games, but the mic doesn\u2019t work so it\u2019s no good for gaming if you wish to communicate with other players.The mic is also rubbish for phone calls! But I\u2019m not a fan of not having my phone to my ear anyway.Overall fantastic bit of technology that is multi-purposeful.", "I have had the pleasure of owning about 6 different noise cancelling headphones over the past year, including the Bose QC 35\u2019s and the new Bose 700\u2019s.To put it short the Bose is still the most comfortable as these tend to get warm especially for a fat guy like me. But... when it comes to best sound quality and probably the best noise cancelling out of all headphones the Sony\u2019s win hands down. At first I didn\u2019t like them. I found them too tight. Then after watching YouTube videos I realised I can almost bend them a little and now they fit like a dream. I was at an airport yesterday for 7hrs and I simply put them on, listened to my music and the cancelling was amazing. When in the air you can use to App to change the headphones so they work better at a different atmospheric pressure and then they worked even better. Just remember to do the same when you land.You can alter mostly everything on these. Treble. Base. The lot, so your music tastes will all be catered for. Unlike the Bose I found I didn\u2019t notice any lag when watching YouTube videos as often when I use my Boses the talking and sound aren\u2019t in sync. Downsides they can get warm. No matter. I just took them off for two mins and then put them on. But keep in mind guys I\u2019m fat and am hot all the time. I highly recommend you give these a try.", "Compared to the previous version the XM2;-They are noticeable lighter-Less tight on the head-Much better power and NC buttons - they are no longer as flush so easier to find-Good volume level, sound. Yes they're bassy.-Texture of the right cup for controls feels much nicer. Unexpected. Easier to swipe-All cables contained in redesigned inner pouch.-Usb c great-Bass make them rumble!-Nicer box which is easily to openNegatives;-the price-the supplied USB c cable is very short", "The sound quality isn\u2019t the greatest sounds pretty bad actually but the noise cancelling does work though and superbly", "I\u2019m confused. I bought these to replace a pair of Bose QC headphones which had broken. After reading all the fantastic reviews on here and other places, It seemed a \u201cno-brainer\u201d to ditch Bose and choose these.The noise cancelling works well, as all the reviews state \u2013 no probem there. But I\u2019m really, really disappointed in the sound quality \u2013 so disappointed in fact, that in view of all the 5* reviews, at one stage I came to the conclusion that they must be faulty and I requested a replacement.However, having now listened to them for several weeks, I\u2019ve cancelled the replacement request, because on reflection they aren\u2019t actually faulty, they\u2019re just simply not as good as all the reviews claim, at least to my ears.Bass is OK, but the treble ranges (where the detail in music mostly resides) are just awful. Frankly they just sound muffled. Vocals are indistinct \u2013 you can\u2019t hear s and t consonants properly. If I was listening to a new song, I would really struggle to work out the lyrics. When listening to complex music with many instruments, the detail, transparency and \"attack\" disappears, it merges into one sound \u2013 you can\u2019t hear the individual instruments through all the others. I\u2019ve had to crank the treble right up using the equaliser to get any crispness in the sound at all. Of course sound quality is a subjective thing and it\u2019s quite possible that the problem is me, not the headphones, but I\u2019ve always used high quality sound equipment, it\u2019s important to me, and I think I know how things are supposed to sound. Maybe there is something \u201cnot quite right\u201d with my pair? But frankly these just sound like a very cheap pair of headphones to me, and I\u2019m really disappointed - I'm wondering if there is an \"Emperors New Clothes\" thing at work here - Now I wish I'd just simply got another pair from Bose.", "I really wanted to like these headphones. They have some very nice features built in, and the noise cancellation seems very good.But I was surprised to hear the sound quality. Very bass heavy out of the box; so I used the Sony headphones app to tweak the equaliser settings and other options, but no matter what I tried, I felt frustrated and disappointed when I listened to music I know and like.The mid-range seems wooly or muddy. Poor staging overall, and it felt like there was something between me and the music.It's very sad that my 5 year old Bose headphones, which were a bit cheaper, are noticeably better than these for sound quality.For me, this was not a good purchase for the price. Returned for refund.", "I have owned many headphones over many years and I have always paid for the better end of the spectrum. All the headphones have had great sound quality both music and gaming.Then I used this headset, wow the music just went up a notch, I was hearing fine details that were just in the background, the tone and base control is spot on, I have no problem with connections to an array of devices, (Samsung S5, P20 Lite, High-End PC, Sony 4k TV, iPod.)  For information, connection break up occurred at these distances. Samsung S5 around 12 meters, iPod &amp; P20 Lite 25 to 30 meters dependent on obstructions.Gaming, gameplay sound quality is outstanding with hearing the minute detail, (i.e. foot's steps behind you etc). Microphones do work well but are not as good as a headphone with mic stalk. I have been told that my voice sounded slightly distant and could get lost in the game sound. But is very clear on Teamspeak.Noise Canceling - This has got to be tried to be believed, I thought oh yeah, but I parked the car in the centre of Cheltenham and went for a walk, now Cheltenham is becoming very noisy with the traffic, buskers which there were three, road works all the time, shops playing loud music etc. I started on Ambient noise and my the mics work it was noisy, Then set to Ambient Noise Control and I would say that 60 to 70% of the heavy noise was reduced to nothing, so to where a good set of noise cancelling headsets would be. Then you push the button again and oh my, it was like the world had vanished, no car noise, no people, no music, you could hear the sudden heavy noise like metal hitting or very loud babies. But put your music on it all vanishes. It was like walking around in another world.These really are great headphones that are very comfortable to wear for long periods, my longest is around 8 hrs and no discomfort or overheating. I know they are very expensive, but you have to treat yourself once.", "The noise cancelling is pretty incredible if I'm honest. It's so good that if I'm walking around traffic and people I don't like having it switched on. I feel so detached from everything around it makes me feel uncomfortable. The NC also doesn't feel like a huge pressure is crushing your skull which I found with the bose products.Sound quality is where it gets tricky. With the NC and ambient sounds turned off so they're standard Bluetooth over the ear headphones, the audio quality is outstanding. FLAC files streamed using LDAC are a joy to listen to and I've started relistening to my collection. For my ears (and everyone is different) the bass is deep yet controlled. Mids don't overpower and the highs are clear and bright without being even close to harsh. The sound stage feels open but I think my Akg N60nc had a more open feel.Where the sound falls down is when you engage noise cancelling. Mids seem to dominate and take over. The bass is still there but far less punchy and I would say throttled, compressed or squeezed. Music becomes a little flat and uninteresting.The ambient noise feature is really good and works well. Not sure if I would use if interacting with someone. I feel it's a bit rude not taking headphones off to talk to someone, but that's just me.Build quality seems good. The case is good quality and will provide a high level of protection. They are large headphones and take up a bit of space in a bag but they're over the ear style so that's what you expect.The app is OK and you can change the character of the eq to suit you. The preset ambient sound effects are a gimmick. I can't think of any reason I would enable any of them.Overall I love these headphones and I see the NC feature as a bonus feature when needed but wouldn't enable if I didn't need to.", "For the price &amp; the controversy of these headphones I was expecting something spectacular. Though the noise cancelling is fairly good (minimal details still puncture through) I couldn't say the same about song quality. The bass is okay but it over powers every other instrument you could hear. In terms of comfort these are horrible for long use. I wasn't able to keep these on my ear for more then 40 minutes without having to take them off due to feeling a bit of pressure on my ears. If you have a small face then these headphones will stick out like two stones attached to the side of your head.The build quality in itself is excellent, feels very robust &amp; durable despite being plastic.If you want a pair of headphones for the sound quality, I wouldn't reccomend these though, if you need a pair of headphones for the noise cancelling in itself I would definitely reccomend these.I did return mines due to the cons out weighing the pros but that was a personal choice.", "While the sound quality and noise cancelling are good the build quality is VERY poor, hence the overall 1 star review.After less than 6 months of light use (including always putting them back in the carry case when not in use) the case cracked in the same place on both sides, where the headband attaches to each side.Having looked on Sony Community sites in the UK and US I have discovered that others have had exactly the same problem, which suggests to me that this is either faulty design or a manufacturing issue.I sent the headphones to Sony who have told me that they consider it \"physical damage\" which is not covered under their warranty.I have reported this to Amazon and I am hoping they will be able to do something to help.", "This is my 3rd set of active noise cancelling headphones/earphones I've owned. These are definitely the best for sound quality and noise cancelling technology or Noise Reduction (NR) technology.Mobile app - gives extra controls:To get the most out of these headphones, you should install the app for either Android or iOS, I tested it with a Samsung Android phone.  The headphones still works without needing the app, it's just the app gives you more control and is capable of changing the level of NR based on your movements.  There are four types of activity, transport, running, walking, and stationary.  Each one can be adjusted to allow varying levels of background noise to come through, so you can set it so you can still hear people talk or cars approaching when you walk down the street.Sound QualityI chose these headphones after reading the online reviews on various technology magazines and hi-fi sites, and they say these are the best sounds on the market today for a Bluetooth NR headphones, and I think they are spot on.  Playing music or audiobooks through them is pure pleasure, it's so easy to listen to.  With the help of noise cancelling, you don't even have to turn the volume up that high to hear the music properly. Everything is perfectly clear even at fairly low volumes.One improvement over older NR headphones is you can set the NR to a minimum but still keep the circuitry on, which helps give the best possible sound from the headphones.  This is something older NR headphones suffered from, where the sound quality is dramatically reduced when the NR is turned off.DesignAnother reason for choosing these Sony headphones is it's less conspicuous than say a Bose, which shouts expensive to the world, Sony on the other hand is rather common, and it's not obvious these are expensive.  The last thing I want while traveling on public transport is have a thief magnet stuck to my head.Quirks and nigglesWhen the app changes from one activity type to another, eg when you go from sitting down to walking, and the app detects it, it will switch the mode automatically, which is great, except for the beep interrupting whatever you're listening to. Not a major issue, but would have been nice if you could switch the beep off altogether.When I first installed the app, it told me to update the firmware on the headphone, which took probably 30 minutes, and you are constantly reminded to not switch off the headphone or plug in the charger as that could kill the headphone. Bit of a nerve racking 30 minutes. Would have been nice if it didn't take so long.These headphones are big, not huge, but people with small heads may find them a disproportionate to their head. I'm ok as I have a large head, and the overhead band isn't too tight either, which is often the case.All in all, I am extremely happy with these headphones, and can see myself using them more than any previous headphones.", "This is the first pair of Sony headphones I have ever bought. I read many reviews before purchasing and most of them stated that this product is the best on the market.The battery life is excellent. The noise cancelling is stunning, without making you feel artificially detached from the world around you. I like the single touch with a hand to allow ambient noise (typically a voice) to be heard. Removing the hand from the right headphone cup restores the noise cancelling immediately. Touch control on the right hand cup takes a bit of trial and error to get consistency but it quickly becomes second nature. The two buttons on the left hand cup seemed awkwardly placed at first, particularly as you need to locate both buttons by touch to make sure you are about the press the correct one. Again, this becomes second nature quite quickly.Although you can quickly pair and use the headphones, you will definitely not get the best out of them if you don\u2019t download the app and change the settings to meet your personal preferences. I found the sound very bass heavy with no brilliance at first and was very disappointed. However I changed the graphic equaliser in the app and things got much better. You need to make sure that the graphic equaliser setting on the headphones does not conflict with any similar settings you have on your mobile device, otherwise they may conflict with each other and give poor results.I wear glasses and find that many over ear headphones (as distinct from in or on ear headphones) can be quite uncomfortable. These are possibly the most comfortable headphones I have ever worn.This product is not cheap, so I guess that you expect them to be of excellent quality. They are.", "Ok so I'm not an audiophile, I just like music, so this is a layman's review. When I say I like music it ranges from classical, opera, film, through to rock music. Everything except modern pop. I hate noise and just like to hear what I want to hear, not people talking, or music that I don't like. Previous using BT earbuds and screwing them deeper and deeper to try and get silence. I intially looked at getting better earbuds then decided I'd be better with over ear ones. Took ages to decide between these and Bose QC35 and in the end plumped for Sony.The noise reduction is just amazing and even without music on the world is much quieter. This of course means that you can listen to music at a lower volume. The sound to me is great  and I'm very impressed with that.The app is good too and easily connects quickly with my aging Sony Experia E5 and gives all kind of available tweaks.I tried out a few tracks of all different kinds of music and they all sound great. Hoovered with them on yesterday \u2713  Big test was always going to be the train and planes. So I waited for at least a train before reviewing. Oh my !  Even before I put the music on most of the train noise is just gone. Not total silence but really amazing when you lift them off. Turning music on makes it even better and for the first time did not have play ACDC to drown everything out. I could actually play quieter music and hear properly. I'm currently typing this in a coffee shop with music playing, people talking and a loud hum from machinery and listening to music I'm in total silence.The control swipes work well and the battery life is great. I got them on Saturday, this is Wednesday and have listened for a few hours each day and sitting at about 80%.The case is good and the only slight thing is the charging cable is a bit short but just needs to be allowed for.So much better than in ear buds for sound and comfort and I'm really glad I bought them so far.Oh and did I mention no wires ?  It just works. AWEsome", "I would imagine that a large number of people looking at these cans want them for the noise cancelling. If that's the case then all I can say is: BUY IT NOW! I've used these on two 12 hour flights in the back cabin of economy class and the noise cancelling is truly astonishing.From the moment it kicks in the roar of the engines disappear to a feint hiss. Crying babies are distant background noise. Cabin crew walk up and down with their lips moving but there's nothing to be heard. Then all you need to do to complete the scene is plug in (or bluetooth connect) your phone or hook up to the in-flight entertainment and your choice of music is *all* that you will hear. Honestly, when I took these off at the end of the flight it was such a shock it sounded like someone had started a riot on the plane. How did I ever fly without them? No wonder I could never sleep on planes. Now I can. Now if Sony can just get them to make the plane's seats more comfortable I'll literally throw money at them :)Some technical notes. On bluetooth the battery lasts about 8 hours. 10 minutes or so hooked up to a power bank and it was back up to about 40%. On 3.5mm headphone cable (it's supplied) it lasts MUCH longer. I had it constantly playing for 11 hours and it still announced at least 80% charge remaining. The noise cancelling will only work if the ear pieces can make a seal around your ears to stop outside interference. Mine sealed fine. If you have funny shaped head they may not work for you. It comes with a very nice hard case; no need to buy one. There's an app. When you're on a plane wait until you're at cruising altitude then use the app option to optimise noise cancelling - it will tune it to work best at the cabin air pressure.", "Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed with the Sony WH-1000XM3 was the excellent quality of the materials used. The fit is very adjustable and the cups fit over my ears with plenty of room to spare.After charging the battery to full I began pairing the headphones to my devices. This was achieved without any problems. I downloaded the Sony app for Android and paired the Sony WH-1000XM3 to it. The app is a great way to adjust all manner of surround sound and equaliser settings. It even requires a photo of both ears for optimisation (!!).So far the only music I've played are mp3 files but even those, the clarity is very good with a deep bass (initially too deep until I adjusted the levels on the app). A feature which I find the most useful is the right ear cup can be swiped with one finger to pause a track, play next/previous track and adjust the volume level without resorting to an array of fiddly buttons. A giant leap forward in controllability.My Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones replace some Seinnheiser headphones, which while very good, didn't quite cut it with their noise cancelling. The Sony WH-1000XM3 are much improved in both NC and sound in general. They were too expensive at \u00a3320 but the price has dropped over \u00a370 to a far more affordable level for their quality and extremely high rating in all the music and gadget press.The Sony WH-1000XM3 come with a hardcover case, wired 3.5mm connection cable, a very short (6\") USB/USB c charge cable and aircraft adapter.", "Are these XM3's better than XM2's? Short answer - yes. Had a pair of XM2's briefly and was very happy with them until I moved over to the XM3's. Differences are subtle - ear pads, internally, are slightly bigger. This may account for the slightly improved aural experience. Head band has been improved with extra padding making these Sony's more comfortable to wear for extended periods.Noise cancellation is superb. You can tweak settings via a phone app. First time out on a busy road, was blissfully cut off from all the unpleasant ambient noise until someone walked past on their mobile phone. Could hear what they were saying. Then, back to total silence. You can temporarily cut off noise cancelling by cupping your hand over the right headphone - works well. There are no button controls for volume etc. Control is effected by swiping up or down for volume on right headphone. Track forward is horizontal swipe with track back also a horizontal swipe in reverse. Can be a bit hit and miss but until you gauge the sensitivity of gestures needed to effect the change(s) you want.Battery life is excellent and the short ten minute charge feature is brilliant. Phone app previous mentioned is pretty comprehensive allowing you to tweak settings including sound effects.Sony Wh1000 XM3's deliver a rich wonderfully clear sound that will put a smile on your face.", "Always been a fan of Sony headphones, however I haven\u2019t bought a pair of overhead headphones over the last 2/3 years, been using more IEMs over the last few years.I have been waiting for these pair of headphones for a while and they were out of stock for the last few months, so as soon as I notice when it was back in stock I ordered it instantly.With the standard Sony packaging, everything came looking decent, and there is a case contain all the cables and the headphone itself.It was very simple to set up, I just turned it on and use my iPhone to search the headphone it was connected without hassle.The sound quality is decent, I would say the treble-bass End range can be improved a bit more. But overall it was great.I am really happy with the noise cancelling function, however the actual touch control sensibility can be improved I believe.", "Great product in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation.In fact, the NC is outstanding and second to none. It's almost as if you're in a world of your own. Even on the train, the NC cancels out the rumbling noise from the train engine and wheels. The sound quality is very good, however the default bass is a bit too muvh.It's a shame that this flagship headphone is let down by the flimsy controls on the right ear. You have to double-tap to play/pause music and swop left/right skip tracks and up/down for volume. But it's a pain to get it right, an onlooker will wonder why you're fighting with your headset at times. This is very annoying! Reminds me of the over-sensitive sky Q remote (which has now been updated to a more reliable one). If the controls can be fixed, this headset will be the best for years but for now, be prepared to tolerate the flimsy controls. The app is very good and battery life appears great!", "I did quite a lot of research before buying these as I could get the Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs for considerably less through a work discount scheme. In the end I was happy to pay more so I could get the features that were important to me.Firstly these have a USB C connection for fast charging. It\u2019s far superior and more robust than the old micro usb on the Bose and in keeping with my phone and iPad cables.Secondly these have a warmer, slightly bassier sound profile out of the box. I\u2019m not one for messing with equalisers and from what I\u2019ve read the Bose need a tweek to get punchier bass. I\u2019m not talking overpowering bass like you\u2019d get with Beats headphones, just a little more punch. Pretty much every review or comparison I\u2019d read suggested the Sony\u2019s sounded better.These Sony\u2019s also support more HD audio codecs such as aptx, aptx-HD and Sony\u2019s own LDAC. This is in addition to the very basic SBC and Apple\u2019s AAC. The Bose on the other hand only support SBC and AAC. Whilst my iPad only supports those used by the Bose headphones my Android phone supports all of the other HD codecs including LDAC for higher bit rates.The noise cancelling really is great and acknowledged as better that the Bose QC 35 IIs. But in addition you can also pipe in ambient noise at 11 different adjustable levels to suit your own tastes. This makes them great for use at work or when out near busy roads. They even have an added feature called focus on voice which does just that....so you can adjust the ambient levels and focus on just voices. The app is good and can be used for adjusting all of these settings but I don\u2019t recommend using the Adaptive Sound Control feature which adjusts the ambient noise levels and noise cancelling based on what you are physically doing. It uses your phones sensors and doesn\u2019t change reliably enough. Adjusted settings are then stored on the headphones so they will stay set if you connect with another device. Speaking of which it IS possible to connect to two devices at once. But only if one device is used purely for calls and the other for media. So one of the devices would need to be an android phone.A really useful feature is being able to momentarily lower the music volume and use the external microphones to pipe ambient sound into the headphones. All you have to do is cup your hand over the right earphone so great when on a flight for instance and someone speaks to you.Lastly the swipe gesture controls work well for playing, pausing, skipping music plus Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa.The X4s may be announced soon which may have BT 5.0 instead of the 4.2 that these have. But they will likely cost much more at launch and BT 5.0 only increases range from what I can tell.In summary these are great and I highly recommend them!", "I initially purchased the Nuraphone, and whilst I was happy with the sound quality, the volume (these go LOUD and you can max the volume out without any clipping) and the short-term comfort, I wasn't happy with the proprietary cables, unable to purchase any third party longer cables, for \u00a3350 you don't get a lot of features, the app is bare, and they gave me temporary tinnitus and aero-otitis. but the Nuraphone made me realise a few things -1. That I don't need quite that level of sound quality.2. That I NEED ambient pass-through.So I sent the Nuraphone back and after much searching I came across the Lindy BNX-100 which appeared to have all of the features of the Nuraphone that mattered to me for just over \u00a3100! They arrived and had it not been for an annoying issue they would've been pretty damn surprisingly bloody good considering the price; the issue was that they have the automatic pause/resume feature, similar to the Nuraphone (except it is a LOT quicker), but it's just too sensitive, you can tap the headset and it'll cause your music to pause, I'd often end up in a loop where I'd be out, listening to some music on my BNX-100, and the music would just pause, so I'd go to press the play/pause button, putting my hand on the headset in the process and the music would resume, so I'd take my hand off and the music would pause, so I'd go to press the play/pause button, putting my hand on the headset in the process and the music would resume, so I'd take my hand off and the music would pause, so I'd go to press the play/pause button, putting my hand on the headset in the process and the music would resume, so I'd take my hand off and the music would pause, so I'd go to press the play/pause button, putting my hand on the headset in the process and the music would resume, so I'd take my hand off and the music would pause x100... I sent them back. They didn't go as loud as the Nuraphone, but you could max the volume out without any clipping.So I just splashed out on these, the 1000Xm3, after hearing so many good things about them. I'm not going to beat a dead donkey by going in to accessories, build quality, premium feel etc... these are probably the most popular premium ANC Bluetooth headphones. I'd place these in the middle of the Nuraphone and BNX-100 in terms of volume, not quite as loud as the Nuraphone, but plenty louder than the BNX-100, and they do sound amazing, not quite Nuraphone level amazing, but still amazing, the sound signature is perfect for my listening... at up to around 85% volume with ANC on and then beyond that the bass is completely blown out, I actually bought a 2nd pair because I thought the 1st pair was faulty... both pairs start to clip beyond 85% volume + ANC! Literally the only pair of headphones I have ever owned that can't handle their own maximum volume. Adaptive sound control is a nice feature on paper, but bloody annoying in practice (though these was an update to adaptive sound control today which I didn't test as I left the feature turned off) when it pauses your music for 1-2 seconds every time you move, it also drains your phone battery VERYYY fast, another annoyance is that you have to use a third party EQ if you set 'priority on sound quality' (use any codec other than SBC or AAC). There is a handy feature where you cover the right earcup with your hand to attenuate the music and amplify ambient sound, I just would've liked an attenuation slider in the app where you could adjust how much the music is attenuated and how much ambient sound is let through, I also would've liked to have seen the same applied to the NC/ambient button; it's actually baffling why the latter isn't already possible with the 1000Xm3 to be honest.At IFA there was a new feature showcased coming to the 1000Xm3 at some point via a firmware update, something about 3D sound - you use the app to scan your ear and it builds a profile... just like Creative's Super X-fi, but if it is anything like the lovely Super X-fi, then expect your 3D'd music to sound nice and crap.To answer the title question... no, these aren't it. As much as I love the sound below 85% volume, on a set of headphones costing almost \u00a3300 I should have the option to whack the volume right up without distorting the bass, so I'm going to return these and see if the Sennheiser PXC 550 gets a price drop, if not I'll wait for the Sennheiser PXC 550 II or the Sony WH-1000Xm4. It's a strange one because these are tuned towards bass... but then (unless I've been really unlucky and received two faulty pairs) don't seem to be able to handle it at volume and I wouldn't recommend these for any sort of bass head, anyone saying that these headphones are for the bass head has probably not tried the Skullcandy Crusher Wireless or 360, the Sony XB900N, or the Nuraphone, for non-bass heads though, these are well built, comfortable, light, the included case is so sexy that you could bang it on MyFreeCams and it'd have money chucked at it, they have lots of features (with more to come), hands down the best ANC on the market with no cabin pressure, SBC, AAC, aptX, aptX HD and LDAC codec support, and the sound quality is very very good.", "If you want true Hi Fi headphones, don't buy these. Don't buy these, don't buy Bose, don't buy Sennheiser, don't buy any wireless noise cancelling phones. But if you need the noise cancelling facility, if you travel a lot or if you like to sit in the garden next to a busy road, then these Sony headphones should be your first choice. The sound quality is excellent mind you, it's just that you can get better for less by buying a wired pair. Do your research and read the reviews.If I have one criticism, it's this. They tend to sound a bit 'warm' for my liking, on the standard setting. Change the EQ to 'bright' and things liven up considerably, but here's the problem - you can only do that by switching off the higher quality audio codecs. If you want to use anything like LDAC, or even APTX, you can't use the EQ facility. At all. Which is a bit daft, if you ask me. Most people won't care, however, once they hear just how much noise these can remove. (You might want to spend ten minutes dabbling about in the Sony app to ensure that maximum noise cancelling has been selected - at first I thought these were no better than my old Sennheiser Momentums, until I realised that there was a way of altering the settings) And if I'm being totally honest, I can't tell the difference between the different codecs anyway. If I'm sat in the middle of a noisy bus, listening to rock or pop music, I tend not to worry too much. Save the High Res files for when you're at home in your dedicated listening room, that's what I say.", "I can\u2019t offer comparisons with other makes, as I\u2019ve not tried them. Bluetooth connection is very stable. Excellent noise reduction, which was my main reason for buying these headphones. Comfort is also very good, though I do find them uncomfortable if I\u2019m wearing them for longer than an hour - my ears begin to sweat! Really fantastic when watching an atmospheric  film like Alien, as you experience total immersion in the movie. An added benefit is you can be in the same room as other members of the family, and they are not disturbed with any noise leakage from the headphones . Music also excellent- I\u2019m picking out individual instruments with a new level of clarity right across the sonic range in tracks I\u2019ve listened to umpteen times previously. The poorest part for me is the touch swiping the right cup up/down for volume, and left/right across it  for next/previous track,  as the action doesn\u2019t register too many times for my liking. Battery length is very good, and although I\u2019m probably getting around 20 hrs average between charges, I still regard this as more than acceptable. Also impressive is the quick charge feature - five minutes you have a few more hours listening time! Unfortunately the charging lead is very short (only 16cm between a USB and a USB C connection to the \u2018phones).  Using as a wired set is also very good, (even though supplied lead isn\u2019t very long-118 cm ) because the closed cups are a very good noise suppressor, even when the \u2018phones are switched off. The free smartphone app is adequate, but I\u2019m not a fan of having to scroll down the screen to find all the features that I may want to adjust or change. For me that makes the process more clunky and puts me off changing any setting because I can\u2019t do so as quick and easy as I would like. For that reason, I rarely use it.There is a clever folding mechanism which allows the headphones to be snugly fitted into a travel case. Also included is a headphone adapter for airline travel. In conclusion my criticisms above are only minor ones, and based on my own experience over a period of a month. But nevertheless I feel that together they are enough to knock off a star from a full marks score.Overall, very pleased with the purchase-nice build quality. I would thoroughly recommend these!", "This product is full of quality, when it comes to sound, build, packaging, &amp; looks.The ambient control feature is quite usefull if you want certain ammount of sound to pass.Noise cancelling mode is quite good especially once you get used to it.The reason i said, its all about expectiations, becaue when NC is on and no music is playing, the noise coming through is massively reduced, but i have seen people expecting nothing should come through, and that is not the case. Its a limitation of current technology across all similar product.", "Prior to the WH-1000XM3 headphones, i owned the Bose QC35 Series 1 and the Series 2s. Whilst each of these headphones have their own pros and cons, on average I have found the Sonys to be the final winner.The XM3s are an absolute beast at functionality and noise cancellation. As soon as you put these on, you find yourself immersed in your music. The bass is whilst not as good as the QC35 Series, it does the job. And if you were to look at balanced sound, these pack a heartier punch. If you want just bass, then probably the Beats by Dre headphones that Apple peddles will be the ones for you.The noise cancellation is tremendous. In every way i have found these to provide better cancellation than the QC35s both series 1 and 2. They block out all of my travel sound as I sit on a packed train into the city. The connect seamlessly to my iPhone X and hardly ever cuts out.The touch controls are slightly less exciting compared to the QC35s. The QCs are button controlled and you can double press buttons and have up and down volumes. Alternatively, like the old Parrot headphones, the Sonys require you to swipe up and down and left and right in order to control. You also have a double tap for play and pause (along with answering and ending a call). These controls whilst seem like a step in the right direction, are still in their infancy. I have found on one of my other units of these (which were returned) slightly unreliable, in particular in hot, humid and extreme cold weather. I have found in extreme cold weather, it will sometimes register phantom touches, and in extreme warm weather, touches are not registered. Where as for the Bose headphones, the buttons are always responsive.The earcups are more comfortable than the QC35s, they are padded and smell great of leather. The give when you pull these out is elastic and you can wear these comfortably for a 12 hour flight without issue. However note that these are slightly more shally than the QC35s, so those with big ears will find you ear touch the edge of the speaker. Not really an issue for me - and i think they are comfortable enough to not be an issue. One issue with these headphones is that you need overall cup fit and isolation for the ANC to work. This means your ears are completely covered, and hence on a hot day - you'll definitely get some sweaty ears. Not the most comfortable in hot weather.These headphones are not rated to be waterproof. I have however worn these in the rain before without issues - but i would warn against wearing them in heavy rain as you dont want to damage your device!Battery life is excellent - i often dont have to charge them for a couple of weeks. I use them on a daily basis on my commute and have never ran out of battery. You can charge them via USB C and and there is quick charge functionality to give you a bit of juice for a small amount of charging time.The app is much more sophisticated than what Bose provides. It allows you to customise the level of noise cancellation from 1-10 and you can set it to automatically switch between noise cancellation modes. For example if you are on transport and it detects this, it can turn down cancellation so that you can hear the announcements. However i find this to be only a bit more than a gimmick as it also uses more battery life in doing this. You can also manually set how much you want to cancel noise without the detection system. There are great equalisers and positioners which can customise where you want the noise to be coming from. I haven't really figured out a practical use for this yet.My only real issue with these headphones is the way it folds. Someone at Sony really messed up when it came to designing how it fits into the case. Somehow you can't pull it out of the case, straighten up and put on. You have to take it out, twist it around 180 degrees and then put it on. A silly little thing, but whoeever designed the hinge should really focus on real life use before finalising. Sure it is a small detail, but it is an important one in the overal customer experience.Despite a couple of small snags, you'll end up hearing songs of the past the way they were meant to be heard. These are miles ahead of the competition at this point in time and at this price point. Whilst a bit pricier than some of its competitors, it has the best in class ANC technology. Though i haven't actually tested the Bose 700s yet, so it could swing back for me. But if you're looking for tried and tested magnificent headphones. These are the bad boys for you.5/5 recommended.", "Bought these after agonising over different brands such as Bose and even the Surface headphones that were rated best by the Which? website. \u00a3270 is a lot to spend on headphones but I was willing to spend the money if they truly lived up to what I wanted i.e. excellent noise cancelling, excellent sound quality and really comfortable to wear. Also good battery life was important. After reading and watching various reviews I decided to go for these ones. I have to say I've been blown away - noise cancelling is astonishing on these headphones - ambient noise virtually disappears and with music playing you don't hear a thing around you. I haven't tried these on a plane yet but I expect them to be very effective having owned previous cheaper models of Sony NC headphones which have worked well. These are so comfortable to wear, my ears usually get a bit itchy and hot with headphones but haven't found this at all with these. The sound quality is superb and volume goes very loud. Definitely need the companion app with these headphones as you can further adjust settings including the EQ which means you can have the bass turned up - oh my god the bass is so good!All in all I have no regrets and glad I chose Sony over Bose and Surface.", "I bought these headphones mainly because of the highly praised noise cancellation technology. However, soon after receiving them I noticed that when noise cancellation is active there is a constant hissing noise coming from the left earphone. This happens every time noise cancellation is activate, and grows louder and more pronounced the longer I wear the headphones. The right side is fine. I've tried the noise cancelling optimiser in the app a number of times but there's no improvement.This issue is extremely annoying and frankly unacceptable for a pair of brand new headphones that cost me \u00a3265. The noise cancellation experience is ruined. Therefore I am returning the headphones after 2 days.", "SONY WH-1000XM3I\u2019ve had many wireless headphones, including Bose Soundlink, which are great but these Sony\u2019s knock spots of all of them.On a regular train journey, with previous head phones, I could still hear announcements on intercom whilst trying to listen to my music or tv.

It started just around two weeks time after i bought them! The noise they make gets to your head like your skull is getting chiseled, and noise cancellation makes it even worse and it's all you focus on.I did ask a store near where i live about the issue and they said that this is a widly reported issue!I am sad to sacrifice the usb C, touch controls, ambient sound control and a superb ANC for just some creaking sounds. I have requested a return and will wait for the next generation of these and hopefully these issue will get fixed.", "I've been looking in to noise cancelling headphones for at least a year or so. I've needed them for a while longer to be honest, living in shared housing, noisy flats, and roadsides I was tired of having to move due to noise problems. After 1 month of using the Sony Headphones, at the time a big gamble as they cost a fortune, I've had an incredible time with them. They work, they just do the job, no more traffic noise, hearing the neighbors argue. I can just shut it all out.Bluetooth is a massive step up for me, the range is excellent when moving from room to room. The sound quality is great, a non issue, all my music sounds crisp, sharp and the balance is great. I've tested even for music production, playing keyboard you really hear the sound clear with no interrupting sound leaking from outside.I would spend hours wearing ear plugs, these headphones have saved me in so many ways, I can only say get these if you're at wits end with noisy neighbors, loud house shares, or just need the opportunity to focus on projects from home without distractions. I'm sad to say they are worth every penny. No disappointments on what they do at all.Take my review and 100% give these a go.", "These headphones are quite remarkable! The noise cancelling technology is very impressive; far superior to anything else that I have heard. The sound quality is amazing - sounds better than the very expensive (and now redundant) wired headphones that I used to use with my Sony Xperia phone. They are lightweight and fold up nicely in their case. They look great and the build quality, finish and battery life are all excellent.", "If all you need is great noise cancelling these are great. If you need to use them for calls outside look elsewhere, they\u2019re terrible.I\u2019ve done a fair bit of research before buying these flagship Sony headphones and to be fair the reviews were pretty spot on. The noise cancelling is amazing and is a massive upgrade to my Hear On 100s. The other point to note is the microphone is pretty poor which means you sound very tinny when trying to make a call. However, this was the least of my problems. Making a call inside was fine but as soon as I stepped outside on a calm windless day there was a horrible, painfully so at times, wind noise coming into the headphones making calls unbearable. I tried going through every option on the app and the three way NC/ambience button but it made no difference. I also tried to call Sony customer service who weren\u2019t helpful at all. I was told that someone from their technical team would call me back but that call never came. I returned the headphones thinking maybe I\u2019d just got a duff pair but the replacements are just as bad. I tried calling customer service again and was advised to return and get a third pair from amazon. Not helpful. I ended up returning my second pair for a refund that I\u2019ll use on a pair of xm4 when they\u2019re released in hope that Sony have addressed the mic issues. If they\u2019re still as bad I\u2019ll get a pair of Bose 700.", "You can't use these headphones to make calls - it is the worst call quality you could imagine. So I called Amazon to get a replacement and they insisted putting me throught to Sony.I used the headphones on the call so they could, or rather couldn't hear the problem. They literally couldn't hear a word I was saying. Amazon refused to honour my statutory rights by offering my a refund. They stated that my complaint would be escalted to management to procees it but several days later I have heard nothing back. I have taken a copy of the chat transcript highlighting all this and will be taking appropriate legal.actions as apllicable.The ANC isn't as good as people make it out either.The sound quality is very average compared to cancelled headphones.Absolutely terrible.", "What can I say about these headphones. They are absolutely fantastic. They definitely sound like a \u20ac300 set. Sound is crystal clear once you turn the bass down a bit in EQ. ANC  is top class. Very little of that cabin pressure feeling you get with cheaper noise cancelling headphones. Another reviewer said the volume was low. Absolute nonsense. I use them at just over half my phone's volume and they are plenty loud.Can recommended them 100%. Well done Sony.", "OMG! I have no words to describe how perfect this headphones are! I have used them in office, on the flight and on the street. Works 100%. Highly recommended for Xmax presents lol. Search is over! I had Sennheiser HD660S, Bose Quiet Comfort 3 and many more and none of them works as I wanted it to works. Worth every penny and I am buying 2nd pair for my wife.

Up until then I'd been using Bose - QC35 originally, then the 700s - whenever I was flying somewhere and noise cancellation was more important than sound quality. Problem was, once I'd arrived at the destination I'd then be disappointed with the sound quality until it was time to fly back. The Bose 700 are good noise cancellers as you'd expect but the sound is a bit too neutral and boring.Comparing the two, on first impressions their carry-cases are similar in size. The Bose is a little triangular so wider at the base, while the Sony case is more oval but slightly more deep. Weight-wise they're very similar so neither has an advantage in the packing stakes. In terms of styling I do like the modern very simple style of the Bose and the way the earpieces rotate and slide up and down the arms. The Sony are more like the Q35, rotating and folding to fit into their case but they are the more comfortable of the two to wear, offering more padding to the ears. Both provide a USB-C charging lead and headphone jack-lead for non-wireless use (Bose hide theirs under a magnetised trapdoor, which is quite neat). Sony also include a double jack airline adapter, which is less common on newer planes but still useful to have.There are apps available for phone for both makes, but the Sony app has much more functionality including taking photos of your ears and using that to tailor the sound to your head. They did sound different after doing this as well. So, on to the important bit: how do they sound? Well, as an audiophile I'll be the first to say that they're not the most neutral of headphones. If they were friends, they wouldn't be the friends you'd phone for a serious debate. These are the friends you want to meet up with after work on a Friday night. They are F-U-N!Firstly the bass is powerful, not in the bad drown-everything-else-out way, but in the get your feet and hips moving type of way. Your fellow passengers may wonder what you've got going on down there but you won't care. I've had some strange looks from the missus while doing the washing up but the time flew! The level of detail is good and the sound is well balanced across the frequency range but with a good weighty feel to it. I've listed to rock, metal, pop, disco and these headphones don't care, they just love playing music and so will you. In comparison the Bose 700s played a bit of Sade and had an early night.The noise cancellation on both Sony and Bose is excellent but Sony have the edge here too. Especially as you can cup your hand over the right earpiece to mute the music and amplify external voices. Battery life is very good on both pairs so the main differentiation between the two is the sound quality and Sony win that hands-down.", "Right off the bat, I'll make my feelings clear. These are superb. I'm slightly spoilt having a set of AKG K702's I bought years ago, a desktop DAC amp and the time to listen to music regularly at home. All the wireless I'd tried didn't come close to the setup so on a cost Vs. Sound quality decision I couldn't justify wireless just for the sake of not having to use a phono dongle when I'm out and about.With the inbuilt DAC these caught my eye and with my wired Sennhiesers I used with my phone finally giving up after 10 years, I tried them. I was, and remain six weeks later, blown away. Nearly all the nuance and tonal range I have with my home listening I have with the Sonys. There is a real breadth to the listening, a richness in the lower range (without any risk of flabbiness) and a clarity in the mids and upper range without a hint of hiss. Even at higher volumes. The detail in the instruments brings out subtleties you will not hear with other wireless headphones, even those in the same price range. Without priming her, I handed them to my music loving 11 year old daughter and pushed play on her favourite Fleetwood Mac song and she said 'Wow, it feels like the band is in the room'.The difference between these and many other wireless headphones is that, no matter the clarity of others I tried, you could hear the instruments playing but with the XM3's you hear the tone of the instrument in there. Not the frequency, but the detail of the actual tone of the instrument. A great example being you can distinguish the finger attack on parts of the bass fills in Hotel California that I previously only heard with my 702's and DAC at home. You can also increase both the volume and lower range on a faster paced track like Metallica's 'Battery' and it remains tight, clear and increasingly punchy as you raise the volume.They aren't perfect. I wish the muting function kicked in more quickly when you cup the right ear piece. The track goes quiet right away but the big lag on the microphones amplifying the outside world means you are always asking someone to 'say that again'. The 'ambient noise' function to let in some of the outside world is all or nothing. You have to turn it up to full to get any real sense of your surroundings but that adds a lot of noticeable hiss during music playback. I get that general tone will be coloured blending in outside noise but at this price, and it be the third iteration, I expect it to be done a bit better, not have to be set to maximum just to hear background noise and then there be so much hiss.However, those are my only gripes and my key need is always the listening experience. Which is excellent, comfortable and a total pleasure. I can't vouch for the additional functions and differential pressure compensation for air travellers, but for the largest use - straight ahead listening experience - I cannot recommend them highly enough. Especially if you are a wireless sceptic as I was.Even at full price I would have spent the money on them had I needed new headphones and the spare cash to buy them before now. However, at the reduced prices you would be mad not to buy these if they are in your price range. So good are the XM3's I'm now looking at my 702's and desktop DAC thinking 'do I really need you anymore?', and can only answer 'no'. The only note of caution is they will expose the weaknesses in the quality of music files, so be careful how you try these before making a purchase and think about what you listen to. If your primary sources are, and will remain, lower quality I would reconsider as you may be disappointed. For reference, I have Amazon MP3's at 256kb variable that sounded mostly fine with my Sennheisers, but with these you can clearly hear the 'warble' you get from the compression. It's not a 'snobby' thing, just that it is very noticeable with the clarity of the headphones emphasising every nuance - good and bad.", "Wow. Just wow.I have owned a pair of Bose AE2W for around 6 years, and used them in the office, during travel and around the house. Always found soy d quality to be fantastic,  but their lack of Active Noise Cancellation meant they weren't amazing for travel. Very comfortable, but a lot of noise let in.Am starting to travel a lot with work again, so was looking to invest in a pair of ANC headphones.Having been I credibly happy with the AE2W and multiple sets of Bose in ear headphones over the years, my first thoughts were to go for the Bose QC35ii.I had my head turned by these Sony 1000XM3s after reading a lot of the reviews on Amazon and various tech/hifi magazines and websites.In fairness, I don't think you can go wrong with either these of the Bose QC35ii headphones at this price range since both are amazing headphones. SInce comfort is subjective, I took a trip to a local retailer and tried on both sets of headphones and found these to be more comfortable, and ANC performed better with the Sony headphones in the store with me blasting various noises from my mobile phone.My experience with these has thus far been outstanding. Sound is great, and the ANC is incredible - my wife was sitting watching Love Island on the TV, and I watched a movie on my iPad with these headphones, and I couldn't hear a thing. Can't ask for more than that. Also effectively blocked out the Hoover when doing the housework.Very comfy, have read comments in reviews mentioning ears getting warm - this is something unavoidable with over ear headphones in my experience, you just get used to having then on over a while.My only gripe with these is that the ear pads aren't easily replaceable in the same way you can replace the Bose ear pads. I have seen Sony will sell them to you directly for $80. The ability to replace the pads is what kept my previous Bose AE2W in great shape for so long, so I miss  that - time will tell if it is an issue with the Sony headphones.", "So glad I purchased these as the build and sound quality is outstanding either connected wirelessly or wired.The overall quality is to the high standard you would expect from Sony and they are extremely comfortable to wear even for very long periods of time.The battery life is very impressive and the setup was very straight forward using the application on my phone giving you the option to tailor the sound to your exact preference.There was a firmware update available for the headphones as soon as I paired them with my phone (that was also a very simple and pain-free process) and this seems to have ironed out any issues mentioned by some of the reviews.Operation of the earphones is nice and simple with swipe gestures for volume/play/pause/skip track/next track and previous track.You can also assign your preferred voice assistant whether it be Alexa or Google and both work flawlessly, noise cancelling is stunning as is the sound quality, wireless range is amazing with no connectivity dropouts, no voice sync/lag when watching videos and they also come in a really great carrying case.There are so many features to go into detail that I could spend hours writing a really in-depth review but all I can say is that you have to hear these for yourself to really appreciate how good they are.I am absolutely thrilled with these and can definitely say that they are by far the best overhead Headphones I have ever owned (and I have owned many).Highly recommended.", "After a lot of deliberation, I decided to buy these headphones over all the others. I have been a Sennheiser fan for decades, so it was a tough decision to choose another brand, and I never really considered Sony as a brand for headphones at all. However, after being voted by many review sites as the best headphones in the world, 2 years in a row, I thought that it was a bold statement to publish, and since all the other brands didn't including Sennheiser didn't seem to have a model comparable, I hit the 'buy now button...The headphones come in a sleek box and a very nice case, with a USB charge lead. So you would need a USB plug or charger to charge them. The instructions say it would take 3 hours to charge, but I think they took less than 2. That was the first charge so we shall see about future charges.Connecting is so simple and the fit so nice and are engineered with nice swivel actions so they fit your head like a glove. The sound is easily as good as anything I have had wrapped around my ears previously and they are so comfortable a light, I think I could wear them for hours. The noise cancelling is excellent, it drowns out anything else around you so well, you are left in your own world and it is simply...blissful!The control for volume up/down, FF and REW and pause as well as mute are so clever, I love it! Just by sliding your finger on the right hand cup up or down controls the volume, double tap to pause or to take calls or simple put your hand over the cup to silence the music, if you need to listen to someone talking to you (for example.I guess the reviews are right, these headphones are a thing of beauty and I can't wait to take them with me where ever I go.Well, I guess the praise was well justified", "Purchased these at special price on Amazon and one of my best purchases ever. Owing to impaired vision my wife spends her time listening to Audible books. She won't use headphones or such which means I also listen, whether I want to or not. With my Sony headphones fitted I enjoy many hours watching/listening to music on youtube. I also have an extensive music library on my iMac and iPhone so with bluetooth facilities I can listen anywhere.I relax in my armchair totally oblivious to stories coming across from Catherine Cookson books, I no longer even hear them and prefer the excellent quality of Pet Shop Boys, Dire straits etc etc. Again, sound quality is excellent and I have yet to run out of power, as they are plugged into a USB block attached to my computer for charging. The supplied case for the headphones, is again, of excellent quality.I am happy to recommend these very highly.", "Very good sound output, loud when needed. Adaptive Noise Cancelling worked very well with the Headphones app which allows more sound to  be allowed in etc, where needed.Would have liked it to have been sweat proof or have some protection against this because it is quite clammy when used for a while.Pairing was quick but every now and then (once every fortnight), I get a clicking issue which seems to go away when the affected cup is slapped. Saw a few people have this on Reddit.Outdoors in colder temperatures the touch function isn't so responsive which leads you to have to take the phone out to change tracks/volume etc.If the above doesn't cause concern, it sure is a  solid investment. Only time will tell how durable it really was but in the short term, it's been good so far.", "Got these headphones just before Christmas and I have to say they are the best one I've own so far comparing this with the Bose QC35 ii. The ANC cancelling and sound overall with better bass is slightly better than Bose. I did some tests on on the battery and it almost live up to what they said. Using USB-C to charge is the way to go.However, as always there are cons with this. I've had some issues with the headphones not working properly so when I am out in the cold; at first I thought I did something to it as Siri was activated without me touching it and the ambient sound was turned off and the motion touch was not working. After I did some research, many people had this problem when the temperature was below 0 degrees. This caused a huge problem for me as I expect a premium headphone like this would not have this problem. I also researched the Bose QC35 ii and they are more suitable.However, I got a replacement and I am going to decide if I want to return the item and get something else instead as I wouldn't want to be out listening to music and all of a sudden because of the temperature everthing goes bizzard.", "I have decided to now review these headphones as after getting them I tested the noise cancelling and immediately noticed that I could hear far to much background noise than you should expect with these considering I previously had headphones with no noise cancelling and didn\u2019t hear half of what I hear with these even when changing the settings. People around me can also hear what I am Listening to clearly which is definitely not what should be happening with headphones like Sony which on many comparisons are mentioned to be the best in this price range of headphones. I am highly disappointed as I bought these as family complained with being able to hear the music I listened to so paid a lot more money for a new kind of headphones only to have the same issue and they can hear more than they did before ????? !!!! I am not impressed however in credit to Sony the sound quality is brilliant and is definitely very clear. The battery life is brilliant as well can go a few days without needing to charge at all and even if I did run out I have a quick charge cable and plug which charges to full within a hour or so. Which makes these very useful for travel as they will last you a long journey.Overall great battery life amazing sound even for people next to you it\u2019s great sound for them as well lol. Noise cancelling I don\u2019t think is worth it at all due to being able to hear a lot of what is around you which is not necessarily a bad thing for when your near roads however in your home wanting to block our tv dogs barking or family talking these don\u2019t fit that profile I have tested Bose noise cancelling which is far far more advanced than Sony.If you don\u2019t mind sound leakage even on low volume and some background noise coming through the headphones whilst on noise cancelling then I suggest these are great as the sound is brilliant and extremely good battery life but just a shame there is quite major let downs which is annoying due to the price for the headphones is not exactly cheap.", "Noise cancelling works remarkably well, really makes a huge difference on planes and trains. The surprising thing is just how good these headphones are for listening to music. I own a pair of Shure 846 IEMs and all my music is high bit rate FLAC, so I was not expecting great things musically from a set of \u00a3300 headphones. However, using the LDAP protocol, sound quality is excellent and I find myself using these in preference to the Shures as there's none of the fuss of inserting into ears, getting a seal etc. etc., so they're great for work where I'm routinely interrupted.My only criticism of these is that the first pair I received had a fault with the right side driver - as usual Amazon did a first class job of replacing them.Recommended.", "Having read a number of mixed reviews but in the end  having been influenced heavily by the awards these headphones have received I took the plunge and purchased a pair. Always a dangerous thing to do without testing them firstly. Having had them a few days I think I can write an unbiased review? Firstly they were presented in a very nice box. How can you get excited by a cardboard box? Well it\u2019s that nice I am going to keep them in it long term. The phones themselves are otherwise protected by a very nice zip up compact case with a stretchy net on one face to keep something in. The way the phones fold up in the case takes practice but there is a handle picture to demonstrate how to place them. They arrived fully changed and placing the over my head switched off was like being submerged in the ocean. There is a sudden pressure difference and all around you falls silent. Power on and a very clear voice assistant greets you. Connectivity via Bluetooth is the next logical step and it\u2019s a bit painful as you have to power on and hold the power button until greeted by the pairing mode message agin from your friendly assistant. The instructions state you should look for the LED indicator but how if the cans are stuck on your head? Pairing with my iPhone was straight forward enough but pairing with my tv\u2019s was difficult and getting the cans to reconnect once paired to several devices in the home is frustrating at best. I don\u2019t like the volume control. I thought I would as it is reminiscent of the control I use in my car but it\u2019s difficult and the phones max volume is much lower than I expected with no apparent way to override it? Using the app to make adjustments is good but I cannot use it whilst connected to a device other than the one with the app installed I.e watch tv and adjust settings with iPad? I thought I would be able to connect to two devices the instructions certainly imply you can? Anyway it\u2019s early days yet so as I get to use them with more confidence I may be back to update my review?", "I usually gravitate towards Sennheiser when buying headphones - I have half a dozen pairs accumulated over the past couple of decades and they all still work and sound great.  But when shopping for a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM3 was miles better than anything else I tried.Firstly, the noise-cancelling is freakishly good. The outside world just disappears when you're on public transport or an aeroplane.  It's almost unsettling at first, but now I've gotten to a point where I can't be without them when travelling.All the noise-cancelling in the world is useless if the sound quality can't match.  While the Sony rivals Bose for noise-cancelling, it bests it for sound quality.  It's got a subtle and balanced quality that reminds me of much more expensive wired headphones I've owned. If anything, it's a little too good - you really notice bad quality online audio when listening with these.Looks are less of a consideration for me - all over-ear NC headphones make you look like a cyberman - but in terms of comfort, these are exceptional. I didn't experience any fatigue over prolonged wear, although in hotter countries, things did get a little sweaty... yeah, best to remember that if you're looking in the second-hand market for a pair.I tried a lot of headphones before settling on these. Some I tried did things better than the Sony's but none of them had as good an overall package of comfort, NC, sound, features and battery life.", "I heard that these headphones were something special so I decided to try them.Noise cancelling - was really excellent. They would be great for air travellers.Controls - they have a touch panel, which sounds like a good idea, however it didn't work too well for me. This could be something that just needs a bit of practice. If you want to use Google assistant the noise cancelling button is re-mapped as the Google button - this defeats the object of having it. I would have preferred to have voice activation.Sound Quality - This is subjective of course. I didn't care for the sound of these headphones. I am a musician, I have done a lot of recording and listening to music and I found the sound slightly muddy. For my taste the low frequencies predominated and not at the very low end. If you compare these to Beats (for example) on Beats headphones you hear the bass very well, and it is the very low frequencies that seem to come across. On these headphones it was the mid-to-low frequencies that appeared to predominate (to my hearing) and this was at the expense of the top of the range. My Beats and my Bose headphones both give a sharper, cleaner sound to my ears - but this is subjective opinion.Connectivity - is the main reason these are being returned. They will not connect to my 2018 Macbook Pro 15\". I have tried re-booting, I have reset the Bluetooth module, I have factory reset the attached bluetooth devices, this device will not show up when in pairing mode. I have had 10 attempts with no success.", "These headphones sound amazing, best sounding headphones I have ever had (and I\u2019ve had a few!). Noise cancelling is great, brilliant for using in my noisy office. Taken one star of my review not for the sound quality (did I mention that\u2019s amazing?) but for a few annoying problems.First, you cant have more than one device connect at once (I have some cheap earbuds that allow multiple connections), this means if I want to connect to my laptop I have to go into my phone a disconnect from the phone settings and to connect back to me phone I have a disconnect from my laptop via the laptop Bluetooth settings, its a bit of a faff.Also, there is no way to tell if the headphones are on, many a times I have put the headphones down and forgot to turn them off. The only you can tell they are on is by putting the headphones on and pressing one of the buttons. A simple on/off switch would have been better.Finally, the touch sensitive panel is very hit and miss, trying to turn the volume down can easily be pickup up as a skip track action. Double tapping to pause the play back is not always picked up.", "I had really high hopes for these. I debated with myself for months before finally reading another article on how amazing these headphones were, and decided to buy them.CONS:I live in London and get underground everyday for work. These make my ears sweat like crazy.The noise cancelling/ tightness of the ear cups make my ears pop when I turn them onAmbient sound is totally useless.. it\u2019s continuously changes, meaning your music is stopped / pausedNo way near as comfortable as the Bose QC 35sSound was good, but not \u00a3300 good.I\u2019d avoid unfortunately. These are being returned ASAP.", "Noise cancelling was only OK - weird blips in and out when riding the underground, weird when walking around, decent on planes for ambient noise cancellation but didn't cancel voices much at all, and barely worked at all in an office setting. Good / great battery life - used them for two 7-hour flights 5 days apart and didn't have to charge in between which was very nice. Sound quality seemed good, but I'm hardly an audiophile and with the other issues with noise cancellation, might have been awesome for all I know but I couldn't tell. Also required the Sony app to be installed on my phone, which was annoying - should have been able to just use the standard Bluetooth link like other noise cancelling headphones I've had. I only tested on my phone (iPhone 8+) and using the in-flight entertainment through a headphone jack. Never got the gesture controls to work correctly.Finally, the leather-like ear pieces made me sweat , which is minor (and possibly just due to me being me) but annoying and uncomfortable for long plane rides.Going back to my in-ear Bose QC20i's which a) use standard bluetooth, not an app, b) are far more comfortable for wearing and / or trying to sleep on planes / trains / etc, c) have much better noise cancellation on all trains / planes / cars as well as walking around and in the office.", "After years of buying Sennheiser and Bose headphones (I have collection of 4 Sennheiser and 2 Bose) I finally decided to try the Sony. Even though I didn\u2019t particularly want noise cancelling (which is never 100% anyway) I went for these because the reviews for the sound are good and you can\u2019t seem to get anything without noise cancelling/reducing technology these days. Anyway sound and secondly comfort are the priority for me. The sound is sensational and the comfort pretty good. Having an amplifier within the headphone I am sure adds weight but the sound is richer and fuller than anything I have heard before. All my other headphones lack bass but these have a rich bass which does not muddy the sound. The app and controls are fiddly and the app pointless. I would have been happy without the wireless and the noise reduction because it would have made them lighter and cheaper. But the sound is superb and I got a hundred quid off during the black Friday week so I am happy.", "Like: easy controlling system changing next and previous track easily and increase and decrease the volume, wireless, no wire, fast charging,Dislike: does not cancel noice of 2 years of old toddler sound, when headphone on with ANC activated without music playing I can still hear my 2 year old chatting and also I hear him crying.I think noice cancellation works well when the music is playing, otherwise it does not block outside noice 100per centVolume should be above med level or more to block noiceWhen I double tab on the headphone track stops then I have to use press on my phone to play music back again.Bluetooth pair is not easy , if phone was connected previously with the different device and want to connect to new device then have to turn off previous device to connect it new deviceI have not used any wireless headphone before therefore I can not compare to other headphoneSound quality tested clear and clean, no problem so farI have not tested on the plane so I don\u2019t know noice cancellationIt cancels sound of vacuum cleanerComfy wise I have worn max 2 hours no prob so far but if you listen music longer than that you ear feel like dull with active noice cancellationPrice wise it is very expensive headphone I have spent 270pound after price dropped from 330 which I do know, is it worth that money?I can see wh-h900 priced 169pound which looks very goodI have not used Alexa so cant comment on thatRange wise it can hold music far from 4-5 stepsI have bought this headphone with lots of positive reviews unfortunately I have not fully satisfied", "I tried many headphones - the Sony 1000XM3 were by far the best, and better than my original choice, the latest Bose ones. Sound quality is decent and the battery goes on and on and on. I wouldn't recommend these for home use where you don't need noise cancellation - you can get better sound quality with many other headphones (see B&amp;O Play for the best sound quality and decent noise cancellation). But for travellers, including those who go on long flights, these Sony headphones are by far the best.Added later: Stopped working after 8 months - sound totally garbled. Sent for repairs but although sound is louder now, it is still completely garbled, like listening to something underwater.", "UPDATE: These are still working great and the build quality is spot on.  I did miss something on my previous review that the charge cable provided really is short.  If you have plug sockets high up it\u2019s never going to reach you\u2019d need the headphones to sit on something for it to reach.I\u2019ve attached two pictures to show you can fit a 0.5 metre alternative charge cable which I got from JuiceBitz and it works great and fits in the case perfect.  Braided cable would be best for flexibility.Without going into specifications as others have explained about them already and me reading other people\u2019s reviews that\u2019s why I bought them here on Amazon.  Also they were cheaper than PC World and either if they weren\u2019t I always seem to run into trouble when using PC World.The headphones themselves are really lightweight and work straight out the box, weird it showed about 5% and then after using a while shot up to 50%? Not sure on that but could of been in storage for a long period and the app on the iPhone was calibrating it.The battery life does hold up to the truth and they work around the same 30 hour charge as my Sony MDR-1RBT ones.  Big difference, these new ones use the C-Type cable and you only need to charge 10 minutes if your in a rush and you can get loads of usage out of them.  Advice: If you have a JuiceBrick 2.0 which has some amp built in it will charge well with this USB type.I have updated to the latest firmware update and please note like the iPhone your need 50% or over to update it.  It takes around 30 minutes to update but with it being 2 megabytes that seems along time.  I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s round the same time flashing some bios chips on PCs that do take that long.  (Some have said the latest update has made the noise cancellation worse but as I updated them straight away I can\u2019t comment before and after).The Bluetooth is a huge improvement over my old pair, probably being version 4.2 and the others being 3.0 but even though the sound quality wasn\u2019t bad with my old pair which are still faithful they lag 1 - 2 second delay on songs playing and YouTube video voices are out like a dubbed movie.They still both do one thing... yes they keep your ears warm not too bad but it you were on a beach with them on I wouldn\u2019t recommend it your ears will be a fried egg.Sound quality is an improvement especially over Bluetooth they are meaty on the bass but not too much to kill acoustic music.  I did notice though running on the 3.5mm aux jack the bass wasn\u2019t as good as my old pair but that\u2019s about the only negative.  Yes I\u2019m running iTunes 12 MP3 320kbps VBR files but the photo attached from Fakin\u2019 The Funk? app show there\u2019s enough quality to the song.Another great purchase from Sony and at least this time I got a hardcase instead of a soft case which is more reassurance when travelling.", "I\u2019ve had my eye on a pair of these headphones for some time (and the XM2s before them) and when their price dropped a little I decided to take the plunge. First impressions were fantastic. Straight out of the box, they paired up with my phone and sounded great - certainly better than any headphones I\u2019d tried before. Admittedly, they were about three times the price of any I had previously, but I could finally understand what all the fuss was about. They really were that good.I listen to a lot of music, and mainly on my commute to and from work, and this is where it all started to go horribly wrong... The first morning it was a little cold, not ridiculously so, but cold nevertheless. Strangely Google Assistant woke up like I was trying to talk to it. It was annoying, but as a one off, not the end of the world.Then on the way home, it happened again. Then a few minutes later it was the \u201cQuick Attention Mode\u201d that kicked in. The music went quiet, all the mics were turned up I could hear all the noise outside. However, like the Google Assistant problem, this was completely unprompted, and worse still, I could do nothing to switch this mode off apart from reboot the headphones.So basically overnight these went from being the most fantastic pair of headphones to the most fantastically annoying pair of headphones.I soon discovered Sony had an official statement on the issue on their website, but that\u2019s not been updated for a couple of months and as I write, there\u2019s no sign of a resolution. Their workaround - turn them off and on again.Were this really only an issue at sub-zero temperatures, then maybe it\u2019s forgivable. However for me it was not - in my experience anything below 5 Celsius could be problematic - especially if it was windy.So after weeks of conversing with Sony support, and no fix in sight, I\u2019ve reluctantly returned them. If I\u2019d purchased these in the summer months, or only ever used them indoors, I\u2019d probably be none the wiser. (And to be honest, if you only ever plan to use them indoors yourself then you\u2019re unlikely to find a better pair of noise-cancelling headphones right now.)There\u2019s also an issue with the Version 4.1.1 firmware update reducing the effectiveness of the noise-cancelling. That\u2019s not a deal-breaker for me though, as I still found them very effective - but paying this price for a pair of headphones I can\u2019t use all year round - that was the deal breaker, and that\u2019s why I returned them.", "Just brilliant. Worth the price. I traded in my XM2\u2019s for these and I\u2019m pleased that I did. Great ear warmers for winter months too!They\u2019re not weatherproof ( they aren\u2019t advertised as such ) so I wouldn\u2019t want to wear them in the rain, but I have a large hood on my coat and they fit under the hood okay. Noise cancelling on public transport is very good indeed. Now I need to go on a flight and try them out.Battery life is great at 30 hours, which for my use means charging them once a week (if that).Sounds lovely too. I\u2019m not an audiophile but I listen to a lot of varied music and these headphones compliment them all.", "I own a pair of Bose QC 35 II so my review will be based on this comparison.The noise cancellation is the same or negligible at worst.Sound quality is similar or negligible, but everything has bass. So if you're a bass head then this will not be a negative for you.The features that come are FAR better than the bose. There is no comparison between the two. I still miss the features that come with the earcup. The app is far more complex, but does provide more features in the end so it's a give and take I guess.I returned this product in the end for 2 main reasons. I have pointy ears and these are extremely uncomfortable for any extended period of gaming/wearing. These inner cup is cut in a straight line unlike bose diagonal cut. Officially bose are ligher, but the difference is negligible, it's just the ear cups that don't have space and have a bad cut. (for my ears, if you ears are more pinned then these will be great!)Second reason is if you plan to use them for gaming then forget about hearing enemies even if they are 1m in front of you and again everything is bassy.", "These are amazing. Never tried noise cancelling headphones before, these drown out almost all background noise. Tried them on the train commute to London, the sound of the noisey train was 95% eliminated and could just hear a very faint voice of person next to me talking. The sound quality is incredible, much better than my Grado 80's and KEF headphones I have. Lovely tight bass and very good range of tuning functions via the app to dial sound perfectly. Not tried the personal mapping of ear analysis on the app, take a photo of your ear and it tunes the sound to your ear shape, sounds comical but will give it a try. Top drawer Sony these headphones are simply awesome. Only complaints - getting them back in the case the correct way is a pain, touch controls a bit finniky. Highly recommended though.", "These are great headphones the noise cancelling is great. You can optimise the noise cancelling to your environment with the app. It cuts out the noise. I have not worn them outside but generally around the house. The noise of the washing machine is just a hmmmmm. Noisy neighbors don\u2019t really hear them. But the sounds leaks out like crazy. Also there is terrible hiss in the left ear when you have the noise cancelling on. You buy these headphones for quiet. Not for a permanent hiss. It\u2019s a common problem. So therefore I decided to return them and get the rival the Bose comfort ii.", "Ok it's a Sony so the good quality finish and well made carry case were as expected but the real knockout is the superb noise cancelling performance. I have owned two expensive top brand rivals and in my amateur opinion these Sony headphone have the edge. Maybe they just suit my hearing better. The headset padding is very comfortable and the ratcheted height adjustment is very slick. I've not measured the battery life but I went through an audio book and more over 3 days and had some charge to spare, so it must be approaching the advertised 30hrs. It certainly recharged in under 4 hours. I've not marked the headset down but the charging cable is very short (about 5 inches) so a little inconvenient plus it doesn't use the very common micro USB fitting which I have in abundance on longer cables so will need to buy another cable or a connector to extend the standard USB end.", "Bought for use on a plane to drown out the noise of the aircraft and the usual bunch of scummers/noisy kids you invariably get on flights. Sat right over the wing, the noise reduction was incredible. Upon using the android app to recalibrate the sound/pressure, the noise was massively reduced. I could still hear announcements over the intercom but that again was quiet.In the hotel room, the aircon unit was noisy, headphones on and the noise was completely gone. Yes these are expensive but I'm really glad I bought them. Well made, great sound with lots of options for customisation through the app and the noise reduction is fantastic (significantly better than the \u00a380 set of NR headphones I bought for someone else). My opinion, if you want the best current headphones, without the worry of something significantly better coming round the corner, buy these.", "Besides the hefty price. its a really good pair of wireless NC headphones. 30 hr battery. USB-C charging means i can use my modern phone's cable to charge it.Cannot use while its charging. but 10 minutes of charging gives you quite a few hours.I dont like the touch capacitive media control. Sometimes it doesnt recognize your action or misinterpret your action.Never managed to get google assistant working with it on my galaxy s8 plus.Due to the nature of NC, if people are talking and you dont have music on, you can hear them quite easily.Owning a pair of audiophile open back headphones, I can say that the audio quality doesnt live up to the price tag. but as an overall product its not too bad", "These are awesome I regularly commute using the train and tube, before these headphones I had to have the volume to the max when watching anything and even then sometime on the tube would have to pause as I still couldn't hear it.now I have these I only need the volume half way its a shame this tech didn't exist 30 years ago might have stopped me getting tinnitus.I am still getting used to the controls but they can take some getting used to.in this cold weather they are great at keeping my ears nice and warm.you definitely get what you pay for I have bought cheap and always been disappointed so with the option to buy interest free over 5 months was a no brainer.", "Got these and WOW, noise cancelling amazing, sound very good indeed altho i feel the bass is a tad weak but still very good. BUT, recently after just 2 months the right ear cup has started hissing while in noise cancelling mode and intermittently it crackels and pops. Apparently this is a well know issue that i have found on sony forums.  I have contacted sony support and will update.  I may be unlucky but a tad miffed at the \"premium\" headphones have failed already. \ud83d\ude24 also even in very and i mean very light wind, you hear the wind through the earcups.Update: sony worse than useless. Returned to amazon for full refund.", "This product is great from a point of view of its noise cancelling functionality, they work a dream on the train or in a busy office. However i marked it down because of 3 factors, 1. the sweatiness caused by the ear pads 2. the fit of the headband is a bit big and cannot be reduced anymore, they gradually slip forward so couldn't wear them running for example. 3. my biggest disappointment, I the fact they can only be connected to one device at a time. I had wanted to be able to answer a mobile call with them and for eg a Skype call on my computer but they will only connect to one device at a time.", "I have always been dubious about buying wireless audio equipment mainly because the Hi Res audio was not supported.  These headphones have completely changed my opinion. They not only sound incredible, you can be approx 15feet away from the source player without any loss of signal or audio quality. There is no more pausing audio when you leave the room as the sound comes with you.I have not needed the noise cancelling because I have only used them in quiet surroundings, that being said without it the headphone pads are so thick and fit snugly that you struggle to hear a conversation in the same room!Another fantastic piece of audio equipment from Sony, they will not disappoint. The set up is quick and you are listening to your chosen audio/tv within minutes.", "These headphones come with a high price tag, so you'd expect them to give excellent sound quality, noise cancelling and connectivity. The noise cancelling is indeed very good, and the settings allow you to tailor it to your surroundings (with a rather hit-and-miss \"adaptive\" ambient noise control that automatically adjusts settings based on your environment), and the sound quality is good (although slightly dampened when noise cancelling is switched on). They are perfect for wearing in the office or at home.Where these headphones struggle is outdoors and - in particular - on the London Underground (perhaps other underground trains too, but I have only tried them in London). The Bluetooth connection is unstable when used outdoors, with the music skipping and cutting out frequently, although this can be solved by placing your phone in your breast pocket instead of your trouser pocket so the signal doesn't have to travel as far - even so, given the price tag I expected better.Worn on the London Underground, they produce a strange effect where the volume seems to jump up and down - I'm guessing this is either due to changes in air pressure or bumps on the track that momentarily break the seal around the ears.I would have given these headphones 3 stars were it not for the false and unnecessary claims about battery life and charge speed. There is no truth to the claim that they last for 3 hours on a single charge (you will be lucky to get 10 hours), and the line about \"5 hours of playback time from just 10 minutes of charging\" holds no water either - 10 minutes of charging will get you no more than an hour of playback.If you are looking for a pair of headphones to wear out and about, I would avoid these; they do not do an acceptable job for the price. However, if you only intend to use them indoors, they are a great pair of headphones.", "I\u2019m using these with both android and iPhone.The sound quality out of the box has a wow factor, it was easy to pair and had no issues with either platform / device. I\u2019m yet to play around with the settings but they sound much more emmence then any other headphones I own.I bought these because I wear glasses. I also own a set of bowers and Wilkins PX Bluetooth which sound great but squeeze the frames of glasses too tight and after an hour of wear become uncomfortable. The Sony\u2019s feel instantly lighter and are so much more comfortable to wear. I recently sat on a train for 3 hours and not once felt uncomfortable.They also fold down small and the carry case takes up allot less space in bag. It carries the power cable and a cord so beats the b&amp;w there too.I\u2019ve not tried the new Bose and now have no reason too, these are my go to head phones for my travels. Look no further, these are king at the moment!", "My mum bought me these for Xmas and sent them to me in the Philippines (where I live). I was so excited to get them after reading all the reviews, but straight out of the box the right ear cup has a persistent static sound when on noise-cancelling mode. Not so obvious when playing music, but very distracting when watching TV, listening to podcast or when just using the N/C mode.  I'm going to have to send these faulty headphones back to amazon now with a \u00a350 shipping fee which I'm not happy about given how expensive they are initially. You would think that for headphones from Sony that cost \u00a3250+, you would not encounter this problem straight out the box. Ridiculous, absolute waste of money!I'm fairly sure it's impossible to turn off the notification sound as well, despite having your phone on silent. I had so many high expectations for these, but I've just been left so disappointed, especially now I have to eat the expensive shipping cost to send them back home.", "These noise cancelling headphones (Sony WH-1000X M3) are the very best money can buy. They\u2019re truly magical in the way they neutralise and fend off outside noises. I tested it by blasting the tv on loudly during an episode of Top Gear, Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s voice was rendered wonderfully silent.I then tested these against regular at home noises and whilst I could see my wife\u2019s mouth moving, I heard not a word. Next up, the true test, my son screaming at the top of his voice...barely audible. Wearing these headphones is like being cocooned in a comfy bubble wrap of auditory heaven. 10/10.", "The sound is very clean, perfect really, but doesn't come with any in built basiness or anything liek seinhessier or bose, you simply just EQ that yourself - but the sound is fine and clear and immersive. I am happy with that.Incredible battery - last for days even using all day long. Controls are super easy and no issues at all - a lot of people have been talking about the controls but I find them way easier than clicking buttons, very intuitive and hard to get wrong when tapping.I have had Bose's QCs before. The Sony's look better and cancel out more noise just naturally from the way they sit on ur head and I think they look cooler and slicker. The finish is particularly nice, matte feel. I have worn them for several hours straight and no discomfort and doesn't get hot really. Just the normal heat of wearing anything over your ears.The only thing I am slightly critical of is the noise cancelling - the Bose QCs cancel out more noise, almost all noise, the Sonys you can hear stuff, higher things like voices are softened but still audible in a distant way, but all the lows are gone and it is extremely immersive. There is a noise cancelling optimiser which actually does work and make a difference, and seems to realease pressure on the ear. The other thing is the standard NC hiss is a little stronger than the Boses.However, these charge faster, feel slicker, easy to use, better technology, better battery and the music is more consistent with the NC on or off or amvient sound on - the sound quality is premium no matter what and the Boses had a slight dip in quality when turning off NC. Overall, I don't think it really matters to compare the two - I love these new Sony's and feel happy knowing that they have the latest tech in them and will last for years and the sound is basically completely true and immersive.Also, the sony case is better, slimmer and nicer finish than the Boses.", "Sadly as uncomfortable as it gets. Burning ears within 5 minutes guaranteed every time I put them on. I've medium sized ears and suppose I must be pretty sensitive as I sold on my excellent OPPO PM2 because of comfort issues but these Sonys are seriously cramped and a heat magnet.Sound is what I would describe as the Sony house sound. Very bassy but fairly controlled and can be EQ'd if desired.I'm a Sony fan boy and own their flagship MDR Z1R semi closed back headphones amongst other Sony products so I was pretty sure I'd like the sound signature offered here.For BT travel headphones these aren't bad if you can tolerate actually  wearing them.The ANC is superb, very impressive.The motion touch control is a massive fail and in my opinion a worthless gimmick that should have been forgotten about during the design process. If you're going to do it, implement it better than this please.I'm going to seek out some Dekoni after market ear pads to see if I can salvage these and make them bearable.All in all a mixed bag for me.UpdateAfter a frustrating weekend with these and discovering their inability to access any kind of meaningful volume control via the touch sensor this pair is going back and I'm hoping the reacement pair will eork as intended.So frustrating to not be able to adjust the volume to desired level once maxed out on phone.Software which to me is generally  poor and overcomplicated, spread needlessly over TWO apps and without a proper volume control. Update to latest firmware 4.2 has level the motion controlsensor utterly confused and useless.I wish they'd keep things simple, sound quality is good enough for its intended purpose, ANC excellent, build better than I expected but the software application is terrible making the hardware almost unusable.I'm fed up of poor quality electronics having to be returned. I do buy much of these purchases from Amazon and I'm beginning to wonder if B stock products are being purchased and sold off cheaply as A grade merchandise...", "The touch pad is fiddly to use and there is lag with controls meaning you will end up in a confusing mess if you use too many inputs or accidentally touch it. The app seems a bit rubbish. It got me to take pictures of my ears for some reason, to find I don\u2019t use any one the apps that will use whatever feature it unlocks. Why not just allow users to use all the features of the headphones without locking them away in apps you won\u2019t use? I was disappointed to find out aptx low latency and Faststream are not supported by a headset of this price. This means you won\u2019t be able to use it with the PS4 and creative BT-W2 with chat enabled, obviously a deliberate move to force you to buy the Sony gold/ platinum headset. It will also mean you will more likely encounter lip sync issues in games and movies, so leaving these codecs out is a rubbish decision. Charging this is a bit of a pain as it won\u2019t charge when I connect it to a USB port on my computer (other devices do) so I have to plug it into the mains which just adds more clutter to my room.The sound is good and noise cancelling works fine. Ambient mode is on but I don\u2019t know why you would use this when you can just turn off noise cancelling which will also save on battery. Overall it\u2019s a very good bluetooth headset in a sea full of very good bluetooth headsets. The battery life is good on the spreadsheet, but my one dropped by 10% in less than 15 minutes which I didn\u2019t expect. For less than a quarter of the price of this you can get a headset with anc and better codec support and longer battery life. I think reviewers have seriously gotten carried away with how good this headphone is. It is good but not as good as the hype which means you may be disappointed. The silver one looks nice, so I\u2019ll keep it.", "OK, I um'd and ah'd about these for ages. \u00a3250 is a hell of a lot of money for a pair of headphones. But I work in an open plan office and really need to completely focus without distraction, so noise cancelling was the key feature. All the reviews said these were the ones when it came to noise cancelling - and they weren't wrong! Putting these on for the first time you are gob smacked by how much noise they cut out. You feel like you're in a sound proof booth. It really is amazing.So then, to the other side of the equation - sound quality. I'd previously has some Sony CN 700's and there was an improvement in sound quality between those and my previous headphones (a \u00a340 unknown brand). There was an improvement in sound between these and the CN 700's but TBH, not \u00a3180 worth of difference. I've read some audiophile reviews of these that say the sound is only mediocre. I guess it's what you're used to. I also suspect if you go for a subscription to one of the HQ music services then you'd see much more of an improvement. But then that's another \u00a310 or so a month and I can't justify that.I also actually found the CN 700's a little more comfortable - bigger, softer pads and a little lighter. Not to really say these are uncomfortable, though.So, in summary, if you're after the best music reproduction, look elsewhere. These are very good, but not worth the price based on that aspect.If, however, you want incredible noise cancelling, then these are fantastic. I can only judge them on the CN 700's which, frankly, were crap for noise cancelling. If, like me, this was the key feature you're after then I'd say yes, even though I still struggle to justify the cost, if you can ease your guilt by telling yourself you deserve a treat now and then, these are incredible noise cancelling headphones.", "Pros:Design (In my opinion on par or better with Bose, but they definitely beat the look of the surface headphones by Microsoft).Comfort - Improved headband and ear cushions (compared against 2nd gen version)Breathability - In summer, they are less likely to make your ears sweat due to the new ear paddingCharging - USB-C charging and also quick charge.Gesture control - Added features that make this really goodVoice assistant button - Google / Alexa / Siri (kinda)Cons:PriceDesign, some may or may not like itThe gesture controls can take some time to get used to itComfort, some do say that the bose are better.", "I bought these because I need to write code and there's a construction site across the road.  When you put these on your world goes silent.  The noise cancelling is awesome.  Equally good to watch Netflix on you iPad while someone else is watching TV in the same room.  The sound quality is excellent.  They work great as a phone headset.  Battery life is good.Negatives:  a little heavy, you notice the weight.  Normal Bluetooth hassle when you want to use with more than one device but no worse than anything else.  Charger cable is miniature and unusual enough you probably won't have a longer one lying about.  I don't like the touch sensitive control surfaces, there's no markings to show you what control is activated by touching where, which makes the headphones look stylish but I don't use those controls often enough to remember without a cue and I can't be bothered googling to find the manual so essentially I never use the touch controls only the two physical buttons and I end up controlling volume etc from the computer/iPad.I also have Apple AirPods - sound of these and noise cancellation is far better, obviously these are also twice the price and much bigger.  Far better on sound quality and noise cancellation than low price Sony and Logitech headsets I used on my computer before.  Noticeably better noise cancellation and sound than the Bose headphones my daughter has but the Bose is pretty good too and these are also noticeably heavier.All in all I'm delighted.", "I owned these headphones for 6 months, never dropped them, carried them in the case, and always were trying to take good care of it. One time while taking those off a tiny plastic broke off which holds some kind of lid (I have no idea why it even is there, access battery?), and now my headphones are unusable, when I put them on, the lid opens up and the headphones starts falling apart. I will probably have to glue the thing and put some duct tape around \u00a3300 headphones so I could use them again. Because the sony replied the warranty doesn't cover that kind of damage.", "I bought a pair of these to replace a pair of Bose QC35, sadly lost at Edinburgh Airport.These headphones have had fantastic reviews and I accept that the sound quality is very, very good.BUT, there are also some basic problems that I can't believe more people haven't called Sony out on.Firstly, you can only easily use them with one device. Unlike the Bose QC35 you can't easily switch between different pairings (or indeed use them simultaneously). When you switch on the Sonys, they pair automatically to the strongest bluetooth signal you've previously paired them to. So if you have a phone and an iPad, to switch between them you have to switch off the headphones, switch off the bluetooth on the current paired device, turn it on on the new one and switch the phones back on. This is crazy.I've also been unable to get Siri to work at all as it initiates and then cancels within 2 seconds.The app has a load of features you'd never use but is missing the glaringly obvious - ie bluetooth switching.They say 'hello' to you when you switch on, but you have to then hold the touch point to get them to tell you battery level (why not just say it when you switch on like the Bose?)Overall, for me, the slightly better sound does not make up for the really bad functionality and obvious bugs.I wish I'd bought the Bose again.", "Purchased these for my teenage son at Christmas on his say so and he is over the moon with them they haven\u2019t left his neck since then he\u2019s permanent attached.So yes these were expensive but also worth every penny.I was super glad to get these during black Friday week so they were slightly less expensive than full price.So performance wise these are fantastic and the noise cancelling I can attest works great.The past few weeks consist of me speaking to my son only for him to walk off as these are permanent attached to his noggins.These have all the usual functions you would expect from a high-end pair of headphones and he especially loved how he can control them via the earpiece via touch.These are wireless and also come with a cable to use via computer so can be used either way.Charge these in the usual way I think it\u2019s USB but will need to double check with my son.He mostly has these paired with his phone which is a 8 edge and it keep the connection fine.Also the battery life is also excellent with these.These are also extremely comfy my son said there the comfiest he\u2019s used and he\u2019s not one to overstate he\u2019s usually quite hard to please.I would defiantly purchase these again you get what you pay for and in my opinion (and my lads) these are with the high price tag.", "These headphones are very accurate and very isolated. Their noise cancellation and isolation blows Bose out of the water. Their clear, crisp, yet still punchy bass are a far cry from the muddy mess that the 35 QuietComfort II produced. The Bose noise cancelling was reasonable, but nowhere near the quality of these. The only reason I can't give a 5 star is a terrible hissing in my right headphone, that only got worse with further listening after resetting after disuse. My first pair were returned afterwards, my second aren't exhibiting this behaviour yet. If you want more bass, the EQ controls give you punch without sacrificing any other tone range. You will not regret these convenient headphones.", "I have a substantial collection of headphones, some of very high audiophile standard. I wanted these for use in my gym, where the music played and the volume used do not fit my taste at all. Although good noise cancelling was required, my main objective was to acquire headphones that sounded really good and paired easily with my Apple devices. My already owned Sennheiser PXC550 headphones certainly sound good, but their noise cancelling was less than perfect and I thoroughly dislike having to turn them on and off by swivelling the right earcup. My first pair of these went wrong after only a month, because of this design quirk. Fortunately, the Sonys have a sensible on off button and sound really good, even in a noisy environment like my gym. They are also very comfortable.  I thus strongly recommend them, especially at the very reasonable price offered by Amazon.As an update to my review, I find myself using these headphones regularly not merely to curb the din in my gym, as was my intention, but also at home, because they sound so very good and are so comfortable. In terms of value for money they beat hands down my much loved Focal Utopias and although they are not really designed to match audiophile headphones costing vastly more cash, such as the Utopias, they certainly give the headphones I am fortunate to own a good run for their money. Very well done, Sony!", "This is the top of the line noise cancellation technology as of 2019. Compared to the Bose QC35 - there is no comparison, this is way better on the plane, on the bus and on motorways. Wished I had bought this much earlier. Let\u2019s you turn off the outside world.Sound quality is excellent with good bass response.Comfort level wise wore it for a 16 hour flight and it was fine. Keeps the ears warm in winter as well.", "Yes, the voice prompts can be irritating. The connectivity can be a bit fiddly when two devices are present. The app is a bit rubbish. But...The noise cancelling is just jaw-droppingly good. I had to grit my teeth to pay this much for headphones, and contemplated the Bose vs. B&amp;O vs. Sony conundrum for ages before biting the bullet, but I\u2019m delighted to say these are worth every penny. Turn them on and your train magically becomes near-silent, even before you\u2019ve pressed play.Sound quality is everything you would expect from Sony, and the touch controls on the cups work brilliantly (especially the \u2018cover to mute\u2019 feature).No regrets over choosing these cans, can\u2019t wait for my next flight :)", "Bought these to use travelling and to cur out noise at work. I tried the Bose QC35ii and wasn't keen on the styling and the sound was a bit flat. So onto the Sony well they are much nicer to look at than the Bose and much more comfortable. I was expecting total blocking out of all noise when Noise Cancellation was activated but when no music/sound is playing then you can hear very faint talking. Not a deal breaker but again not what I expected but having looked on the Sony website since then it's an expected result.Sound quality is superb when playing music and I'm hearing detail that I have never heard previoulsy from RHA and Beats headphones.If you are in the market for some NC headphones shop around and try them all but for me these are the best availbale at this price point.", "Prior to these, I owned the BOSE QC35ii's. I've now owned these headphones for 5 months. I've come to the realization that the ear extremely fragile and scratch easily, unlike the BOSE that have a stronger metallic body frame. These are soft touch plastic and on a single drop can scratch the black color off them, leaving a white surface. In addition the noise cancelling isn't really that good as the marketing misleads. The noise cancelling is bad that I can hear everyone in my office, chitchatting, coughing, keyboard typing . . . you name it. Not the best pair I've owned, and I'd probably advise that if you're after noise cancelling, look elsewhere. The sound on them is alright though.", "I have recently upgraded from the first version of these, and wow, I don't know how Sony have managed to improve on a set of ANC headphones that were already excellent.It's the little things, small incremental improvements. I didn't try the XM2s, but the XM3s are every so slightly lighter, more comfortable and the sound quality better. I'd dare say they're perfect... until the XM4s are released perhaps?The build quality is excellent, I can definitely see these lasting many years; no planned obsolescence here. They're light and tough.On an airplane flight they adequately drown out the white noise and engine hum, but also give you the ability to hear direct talk if required.The associated app allows you to tailor your experience with enough controls that I think anyone could ever need through a simple and intuitive interface.Sound quality is excellent with punchy base and enough detail in the highs providing a balanced listening experience. Personally I prefer the flat EQ settings for most music, but the EQ can be adjusted and this can make a big difference depending on your preferences.The battery life is also fantastic, on a recent trip abroad, five hours each way plus additional listening in airports and while at my destination I didn't have to charge the headphones once, hence I can't give an accurate figure on battery duration. I used them with full ANC for at least 20 hours in total.For fear of contradicting myself, there are some very minor downsides or possible improvements that Sony could make.While they are very comfortable, it would be nice, as part of the incremental improvements, to make them even lighter and more slimlined. They do get very slightly warm around the ears, which I guess all closed over ear headphones will do. If this can be alleviated, hopefully Sony will find a way.Next is the Bluetooth connection. This didn't bother me, since I only ever had these connected to my phone. However, when switching between devices these need to be disconnected from the first device before connecting to another; a problem carried over from the first version. I really don't know why Sony didn't improve on this since this was widely reported as downside on those first versions.The only other comment I would make is on the case. The quality is great, however I really don't like the elastic net on the outside of the case. It's useful for carrying an additional USB C cable, but I'd like to see a little space on the inside of the case to carry a few additional accessories.Overall, these really are a five star set of ANC over ear headphones. A few small niggles, but not enough to detract from a glowing recommendation.", "These are the first pair of noise cancelling headphones I have purchased and have come from being an August EP650 user for the past couple of years.I bought these after my colleague purchased a pair and was raving on about how insane they are.  I tried them on in a noisy office environment and immediately noticed the difference.Without music playing:- I could still hear conversations from people quite near to me.  Not loud but the rumble of the sound of voices.- Fan noise or any other constant monotone noises vanish and cannot hear anything.- bashing buttons on my keyboard becomes a whisper in the background.With music playing at 25% volume:- Can barely hear the person next to me talking.  Literally just certain tones/sounds.- Cannot hear anything else apart from the music.Since I work in the Canary Wharf area of London, I decided to do a lunch break walk with the headphones on and my gosh did these headphones blow me away!  With my music at 25% and adaptive sound on:- Could barely hear any people around me.  In the busy  underground section by Waitrose, which was full of people, I could only just hear the people who passed right next to me.- I walked towards the escalators and my headphones adjusted to transportation mode.  Initially I could hear the escalator but roughly after 2 seconds, all I could hear was my music and nothing else.In terms of actual sound quality, these are beautiful.  Everything is balanced nicely and whilst the headphones don't go too loud, it doesn't matter since the noice cancelling feature makes sure you hear absolutely no background noise.The bass isn't overwhelming at all.  In comparison to my August EP650 over ear headphones which literally vibrate my brain with some songs, the 1000XM3 feels tame but not underwhelming.Overall, I am overly happy with these headphones.  Definitely picked the best headphones to experience noise cancellation for the first time!  Highly recommended.", "The pairing is pants. The app is rubbish and misleads. The software update sticks at 10%. The iPhone says it\u2019s connected via Bluetooth but the music won\u2019t play when it had done earlier. The inconsistency is the problem - it is hard to problem solve when it works one minute then not the next. They\u2019ve tried to inject too many features - all you want is headphones and simple controls. Wretched wretched earphones. I\u2019m going to give Bose a go", "I work in quite a noisy office so wanted to try noise cancelling headphones to see if they'd help concentration. Wow. These are astounding. Someone on the desk opposite insists on playing the radio all day, and with these headphones on (even without my own music playing) I cannot hear a thing - no annoying coughing; phones ringing; general chatter (sorry, I sound really anti-social! But the usual office sounds you don't need to hear when you're up against a deadline). When I first put these headphones on, it was actually quite weird - like being in a sound-proofed room. There is a way of setting the noise cancellation to allow voices to filter through, which would be useful if you're out and about. In fact, I am not sure I'd wear these outside very often on safety grounds. There is an app to download which works well for settings etc. And the controls on the headphones (touch sensitive on one side) work well. I haven't used it for a phone call yet.I'm not the sort of person that usually spends this kind of money on audio equipment (a birthday present to myself), but honestly these are worth every penny. And it'll probably help me feel less stressed about my colleagues!", "After 12 months with the less expensive  WH-CH700N, which are great except for having to switch off noise cancelling when walking outdoors, which was their main use. decided to invest in these, now that the price has dropped.Do they solve the problem of wind noise affecting noise cancelling compared with the others? Yes and no!! Yes, I can now go on my exercise walks when there is up to a gentle breeze and the wind noise isn't noticeable, so no more fiddling around switching it on and off and I get the advantage of noise cancelling for low frequency road noise. However, in any stiff breeze, wind noise is still a problem (with the wind reduction mode engaged)  particularly if the air flow is directly in front or behind. It can be eliminated if you have a hooded jacket.Whilst battery life is good, it's nowhere near that the of  WH-CH700N . As a consquence . I have run out of power on the new ones, expecting the same many weeks of use.Sound quality is good enough for me - listen to the music not the faults! However, it is odd that the features (equalise, surround etc) can only be selected if bluetooth is set to stable connection and not to best quality.", "These headphones are what I can only describe as amazing! They are comfy, not too heavy, great sound, even better noise cancelling, long battery life. They carry a high price tag but if you enjoy the lack of engine noise on flights as much as I do then you will appreciate them as much as I do.They come in a smart protective case with a USB C cable included.There is a Sony app you can download to tweak some of the settings / optimise the noise cancelling depending on your environment.The only negative point is the microphone which other reviews mention. They are not as clear as I would have expected them to be and the person on the other end of the phone said it sounded like I was on handsfree in the car. They said they can hear me fine but it just sounds like I'm far away from the microphone.I did not buy them to make handsfree calls so this did not put me off buying them but it's just something to be aware of.", "They were great when they worked (about 2 days). The volume controls are annoying as you constantly have to swipe on the side to change it one by one. Also, there is a change of volume for about half a second from the headphones get connected and when the music starts playing.There is no instant way to toggle ambient noise and noise cancelling. It's a three step process.1)toggle ambient sound on2)toggle ambient sound off3)toggle noise cancellingMy main problem with these headphones is that they only lasted two days. I would have them charged fully and they would refuse to power on. I tried all the combinations of button presses and resetting and initialising but nothing worked. Really disappointing how these slipped through QC.", "Bought these after much deliberation and trying alternatives. After trying budget wireless headphones.....and promptly sending them back, I bought the Bose QC 35 II. Thinking that these were the \"bees knees\" of wireless headphones after reading many reviews, I was sadly disappointed. Firstly, I couldn't wear them for more than 20 mins because of the pressure on my medium sized ears. The headband was constantly digging into the top of my very receding headline. The sound, I thought was very good, but lacked punch. Great if you like a flat to neutral sound. Not for me. Now these Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones are in a completely  different league. Firstly, they are soooooo, comfortable on my ears and the I can hardly feel the headband. I haven't even bothered with the Sony connect app. Charged them up and paired with my phone straight away. Absolute bliss! Punchy bass, clear mids, slightly recessed highs which suits me as there is no siblance or piercing. I must add that I'm using Poweramp app on my phone and have the EQ set to my liking. Same setting as I had for the Bose, but what a complete difference. I've had the Sonys on for 4 hours now. No fatigue whatsoever. No skipping ( had that quite often with the Bose) I simply don't want to take these off. The build quality is excellent. Took me a short while to get used to the touch controls on the side of the earcup, but comes as second nature now. Wish I'd bought these first, but then again, I wouldn't have been aware just how much better these are to all the rest. Tried NC ambient mode, but to be honest, I found that I don't need to use it. These headphones are definitely staying in my collection.", "Firstly I bought this mainly for the noise cancelling as I'm doing a lot of flying for my work at the moment.  I'm using this with my Samsung Note 9.On flights, noise cancelling works great (wired) and sound quality is excellent.  Tried the app for controls and it want's access to so many things it doesn't need to I uninstalled it.The swipe gestures on the side worked for a month or so, and then just 'stopped'.  Using it with a phone works inasmuch as I can hear quite well, but the other party can't hear very well so you can't really have conversations.Battery seems to work well, but then I don't use the bluetooth much.  Distance I can get away from the sound source on Bluetooth is about a room (15 or so feet).Would I buy it again - yes, definitely as it has made my plane journeys so much easier to bare.  Is it for you . . . depends on what you want.  Fancy controls, no - not dependable.  Multiple devices - no, a real pain to switch devices around.  But if you only use one device, not for phone calls and want top sound quality and noise cancellation with good battery life - it's great", "I was stuck for a while between buying these or the bose.But I decided to purchase the sonys due to the rave about its noise canceling and sound quality.First things first sonys app really is featured pack(Make sure you use your android eq calibration over the apps so you don't loose highest quality blue tooth signal)After that your ready to go , with a little tweak in lowering the lower bass tones I found the sound quality punchy and clear with the headphones excelling with all ranges of songs.Sony's sound chip really does have a night and day difference with other headphones I have used.The noise canceling is a try it to believe it , your not canceling all sounds so don't expect that but you block out so much such as fans or sounds during travel.Over allA- sound qualityA+ noise cancelingSo now the last thingThe function and comfortThe headphones feature buttons for power blue tooth etc but use touch controls for control and song skipping.I do find it very accurate but no where near the reliability of a button.The ability to cup the headphone to lower the song volume and noise canceling to speak to people is a very useful feature.These are very comfortable but no where near the same standards as Bose if you need comfort consider the Bose over these!But overall these are much better than most headphons on the market for comfortability and build quality.Overall buy these headphones if you want the best of the best", "Finally pulled the trigger on these after watching for some time. They come beautifully packaged, ignoring the tacky \"sound awards\" stickers. You slide open the box and the headphones all all cables are packed away in a single travel case, usual warranty and conformation paperwork in the box.Very quick to set up using android with NFC pairing, no mucking about with new pairing requests and pin codes. Headphones came with 70% charge so we're good to go.Out of the box these are very bass heavy, it tends to muddle up higher frequencies. A little EQ trimming and that's solved, however this comes with the drawback of meaning you can't use the sony codec specifically designed for these headphones. On the note 8, not sure about other Android devices the phones EQ settings work across Bluetooth connections, so I can keep the sony codec and adjust the sound profile.The sound, while not audiophile level is still very good for the intended use of these products, which is mainstream usage using streaming services and MP3 files.You are paying for the ANC, which is outstanding. Such a difference with these for droning our engine noise, voices and other background noises. Would I sit in the house and use these? No, I have open back headphones for in the house. Would I use open back phones on public transport and expect the same sound quality? No, this is where these shine. With the EQ setup to my tastes, it has a very clean sound and I get more than enough detail for enjoyable listening.The build quality is very nice, the headphones look and feel premium. Very comfortable with no indications of becoming unnxomfortable or hot for extended use.Quick charge with USB-C means you only need 10 minutes of charging for up to 5 hours of listening.The bad bits.The materials used are fingerprint magnets, very quickly these started to show signs of use, the matte black shows up any oil or grease transferred.The wind cancellation is pretty poor, it throws the ANC into a meltdown.The actual sturdiness of the materials I'm uncertain of, they do not feel like they would stand up to a lot of abuse.I am very happy with this purchase and do not regret it. They do what I wanted them to do.", "The noise cancellation and sound quality are great. Don't expect them to leave you in silence but they really do cancel a lot of noise with minimal hiss and very seldom odd sounds.The controls are rubbish, though. Extremely disappointing.* They only connect to 1 computer at a time* Volume up and down barely work, meaning you'll be awkwardly stroking your ear for much longer than tolerable* It's far too easy to trigger the touch controls when taking off or putting on* They don't seem to detect being taken off at all* Pause works reliably but it's crazy to have me tap twice hard on the ear piece, causing loud bangs, when in a noise cancelled moment of calmOverall still impressed, just hope they revise the awful touch controls with a software update.", "These headphones are the ones you want.Forget Bose.These are the ones.To start with they look as good as you can get, with nice bronze detailing sitting tastefully against the black body.Even on \u2018normal\u2019 mode they block out a good level of sound, but when you turn on the noise cancelling- it\u2019s like being transported to another world. Even on the underground, they detach you from the noise and stress of your commute, leaving you to enjoy your selected tunes.Speaking of which, are delivered to you in a wonderfully clear and bass-filled way. The accompanying app lets you fiddle with various settings and once you\u2019ve chosen your specific requirements, place them in your head, turn them on and enjoy.Even wearing them all day, you won\u2019t really feel them dragging at your head or cooking your ears.The fast charge is also a god send when you forget to charge them and need a boost to get you home.Only downside is the charging cable is laughably short. But you can switch for another longer usbc cable of course and as the battery life is practically forever, it\u2019s not an every day problem", "The price was hard to swallow, but I don't regret buying these! The noise cancelling is excellent- I love wearing them on the train even if I don't have enough phone battery left to play music. I build software and these are great for helping me zone in when the office is busy. The padding on the ears is very comfortable.The only con is that, when the 'mode' changes from one to another (for example, sitting to walking), the audio goes silent for a couple of seconds and you end up missing some of the song/programme/book/podcast. However, you can adjust the settings so that the mode will only change manually.", "What can I say, these are amazing. Well worth the price. You can immediately tell that the noise cancelation works. These are a lot lighter than expected but it's a bonus. The gesture/touch features work with ease. Havent tried calling yet. It does come with a headphone jack if you can't use Bluetooth but the noise cancelation doesn't work with the wire so do keep that in mind.The app gives you plenty of options as how you want to listen to your music. For example, if you want to listen to music as if it were coming from a concert. Extra bass is an option as well, along with a load of others. Google assistant is great as well, she will read out your notifications from apps and gives you the choice to say something back as a reply", "I needed a new pair of bluetooth headphones to replace my Sennheiser ones. I'd had them for many years and their age was showing (a bit like me). The battery was no longer holding its charge and parts were starting to come loose, so time for a new set.I spent hours looking at both Sennheisser and Bose and could not decide. By chance I read a review on these Sony headphones and was impressed.Initially I found a problem. When I connected them to my Fiio X5 the maximum volume level was poor. So tried the phones wired and the volume level was far to high. So back to the drawing board to find out what was wrong.Eventually I found that you can control various things such as track up, track down, volume etc by 'fiddling with the right earpiece. I don't like that idea but maybe I'll get used to it.The sound quality is amazing. There is more than enough bass and the mids and highs are within my liking. All in all an excellent purchase albeit expensive. As for the Noise cancelling, this is excellent. I had my phones on the other day and my wife came to talk to me. I thought that she wanted me to 'lip read' but then I realised that the cancelling effect was brilliantIf you can afford them then splash out, I don't think that you will be disappointed.UPDATE. I've just bought a FiiO M11 and these phones are not very good with the new player. The bass seems to have been reduced and I've tried other headphones and they are OK and after a software upgrade the noise cancellation is not as effective.", "Quite simply the best headphones I've used.I was apprehensive about shelling out at such a high price but I have zero regrets.These headphones make me wonder how I got through life without noise cancelling.I've always been a Sony fan as they typically suit my kind of music (dance/hip hop) and deliver that extra bit of bass I like.I tried a few prior to these based on online reviews, Bose, Sennheiser, Skull Candy and nothing comes close. The noise cancelling is superb, nothing on the market seems to come close. You completely isolate yourself.The audio quality is distinct, the mids, lows and treble all seem to filter through with classThen the best bit, the bass. These are the first Sony headphones I've bought without the extra bass function and they don't let me down. That familiar Sony thump is loud and clear, the app allows you to adjust it to suit your taste and it doesn't seem to be to the detriment of anything elseQuite simply one of the best things I have ever bought", "First of all i want to say that these are amazing headphones. The sound quality is great, with clear highs and good solid bass. The mids can be lacking a little, but this can be tweaked in the app. The noise cancelling is second to none. For low end sounds the anc is better than anything else i've tried. There is great scope for adjusting the setting within the app, which gives you great flexibility. They are also very comfortable.One big issue i have id the build quality. I ordered a pair from Amazon and within a few hours of use i noticed that in a quiet environment the anc hiss was much louder in the left earcup than the right. It also got louder the longer i used them. After more time, a slight rustling sound could be heard intermittently in the right earcup. This got worse, becoming more frequent and louder the longer i used them. I contacted Amazon and arranged a refund, which was given without question. As i needed a pair for a long bus journey i was about to take, i decided to order some from my local electrical store in Portugal. They arrived the next day. After a short time, i noticed that the same problem was starting again. This time the anc hiss increased in the left earcup and then the same rustling sound in the left earcup too. This got much worse during my trip, to the point where it was interfering with the music even in noisy environments. I did notice that with these 2 pairs, when i set the anc to \"wind reduction\" it didn't really affect the level of anc but did reduce the wind noise. I took these to the store i had bought them from and they replaced them during my trip. The 3rd pair so far have been problem free. There is a very slight hiss with anc activated, which i know is normal. (i do have very sensitive hearing) What i have noticed is that when i activate the \"wind reduction\" the anc level is slightly reduced and i can hear slightly more outside noise. I think this is how they are supposed to work, based on other reviews i have read.So the end result is this. I am delighted with these headphones. They sound great, have unbeatable anc, are super comfortable, and are compact. After checking online i saw that others had had the same problem with rustling noises and increased anc hiss in one earcup.Was it worth going through the hassle of 2 pairs not working properly to get a pair that seem to be ok?  Yes!  I love them. On long journeys by bus or plane they are perfect, and allow you to be totally immersed in your music without being aware of your surroundings at all.As far as phone calls are concerned i can't comment. I don't use them for this purpose.", "I have some other midrange noise cancelling headphones, but these are a step up, this is just a initial review, They are very light and comfy, they don't squeeze your head, but the do stay secure. As you as you power them on the Google app on my Android phone installs them and they pair to my phone, you can even pair via NFC, Just by tapping your phone on the ear cup. There is also an app which controls the sound, noise cancellation, and the sound optimisation, as well as have an excellent equalizer. You control the. music play by using gesture controls on the back of right cup, it's very intuitive and easy to use. I finally  bought these when they dropped to \u00a3260, which is a great saving from the initial price. It also means that there is probably a new model from Sony on the way. There are just a couple of things, that could be improved, currently the can only connect to one device at a time. So you have to unpair and pair again to each device, Also the don't stop playing or shut down when you take them off your head, which other promium models do, Finally they could use the newer bluetooth 5. However these are nick pics, these are simply excellent and the noise cancellation is second to none, I can highly recommend these headphones especially at a reduced price., I will write a. more detailed review after a few weeks of use.", "This wireless headset gives excellent overall audio quality and the noise-cancelling is phenomenal. I think the button-less playback and volume controls are okay and haven't encountered any of the issues people have had under cold weather conditions.They are tight enough not to slide out of place while being comfortable on the ears at the same time.Their wireless functionality is also very good. They are very quick to connect over Bluetooth and, though sometimes sound over Bluetooth can be a bit jerky, they're quite reliable on the whole. Their battery life is very long too although the headphones are quite particular when it comes to charging points. My smartphone's USB-C mains charger won't charge them at all for example. I also tried with my non-USB-C phone adapter, to no avail. Then I tried plugging them straight into my laptop's USB 3.0 port and again, they wouldn't charge at all. The only device I've found can work as a charging station for the headset is my portable power bank (which again, doesn't have any USB-C input ports).", "Bought these to wear at work to cut out all the constant work BS babble as well as HVAC/Computer noise. Stunning noise cancellation, whisper quiet when wearing these. Superb audio quality over both wired and BT connection, the latter offering touch-swipe control of volume / track sequencing. Wish I'd bought these years ago, great to be able to choose between a silent ambient space or listen to my favourite head sounds. Not cheap by any means, but if they last a few years then worth every penny for peace and quiet.", "Bought these after sending back the Bose QuietComfort II. Sent the Bose back due to lip sync issues, when watching videos. The sound quality of these headphones is superb. They are really comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The noise cancellation, wow. I thought the noise cancellation on the Bose was good, these are better. I prefer the sound of the Sony's to the Bose as they have a bit more bass. The Google is a good addition but not something i would use much. The only niggle i've got, is touch controls. When you're adjusting them, you can accidentally pause or skip tracks etc. I preferred the physical buttons on the Bose. Overall i prefer these to the Bose.", "I've been using these for about a month, so ready to share my experience of what, for most people, will be a very considered purchase.I have a long daily commute, involving walking through a city-centre and train journeys, so good NC is important to me so I can listen to music, movies and podcasts without uncomfortable distraction.As expected, the NC is excellent. Very isolating at 'max'. Traffic, trains and voices become very muffled and distant and are easily hidden by even modest volume levels of music or movies.There is no annoying hiss when NC is on as I've found with cheaper NC headphones. On my first day using them, I was sat opposite two bawling children on the train and really couldn't hear them with music playing at normal levels.Sound quality seems very good - I'm no expert, but music has good separation of instruments, vocals are crisp and bass is solid but restrained. I do hear little new details in music I know well.Very comfortable and lightweight. I can wear these for two hours no problem. Ears can get a little warm, but I just lift the each cup for a second to let some fresh air in. There is little pressure on the ears, so no soreness.Build quality is okay, but nothing special. I don't see or feel much to distinguish these from headphones costing half as much. You do get a couple of tiny copper accents, and that's it. At this price, I would've expected a bit more, but maybe it's a weight-saving issue. I like the semi-hard case as it's more compact than expected, although there is a knack to folding the headphones to get them in.Bluetooth has cut-out or stuttered on a few occasions, an issue I'd not had with my previous headphones. It doesn't happen that often, and I've found rebooting my phone seems to clear things up. I will continue to monitor it.'Swiping gesture' touch sensitive controls are a bit hit-and-miss - I would have preferred physical controls for track and volume, although the single touch gestures for pause and 'temporary off' work ok.Good battery life.Overall, a very nice set of headphones with the best NC. However, if NC isn't your primary reason for purchase, I think there are probably better value options out there.", "Have had to replace first set as the touch controls had problems in the cold. Bit pointless if your wearing them whilst walking the dog.. or to work in the cold. But second pair work flawlessly.. The sound quality is quite simply amazing and the noise cancelling is a marvel. The carry case is a little large and the charging cable is a bit of a joke length wise. But the sound! OMG its astounding. The bass mid range and treble are nicely balanced and it seems they can handle all genres well.. the app works well and the surround setting are great.. dance music I set to club.. etc.. okay expensive.. plastic.. but very very comfortable and highly worth the price. My advice.. buy them.Add on afterc3 months of occasional use they have stopped charging. Returning for refund.. not having a third replacement.", "First off, I'm no audiophile so the sound to me is fine, generally used for watching Netflix/Amazon and listening to Digital radio on train &amp; in open-plan office.The noise-cancelling is second-to-none.  Having initially purchased the Sony WH-CH700N I wasn't blown away with the NC, so tried other pairs in a local electrics store and none came even close to these, the NC is truly fantastic, makes you really appreciate how much noise is out there! Highly recommend trying these against others to hear just how good the NC is when they are powered on.Have to subtract a star, not due to price (we know it's expensive), but the general fit. If your head is upright and you're walking they have a tendency to gradually start slipping backwards.Connectivity (NFC tap with phone on left ear-piece and it powers-connect quickly) and touch controls on right ear piece are quick and easy, neat feature is putting hand over right ear-piece activates microphone so you can hear the ambient noise.Buy if NC is your primary need, no competition at the moment which is the only reason I can justify the cost", "Originally I was a bit apprehensive about spending \u00a3300+ on headphones. I did loads of research and these came out on top, alongside a few other brands for a similar price. The noice cancelling is incredible, its like walking around in your own insulated bubble. I commute everyday and travel quite a lot and I now look forward to watching all the chaos unfold from my bubble. The novelty of letting friends experience the noise cancelling for the first time has not yet worth off. The sound quality is great, but coming from normal apple headphones it was always going to be significantly better. Battery life and charge speed is fantastic. I didn't think I would appreciate the touch controls on the headset but it's very easy to understand and a feature that adds value. The only criticism is that the touch controls stop working when it is really cold. Winter months will prevent this feature from working. I've had them a few weeks and it still feels like a new gadget I get excited about using. Also, if you plan to use them for workouts they will get pretty sweaty as expected and occasionally dislodge if you are doing an intense set. Overall, extremely pleased with them and would recommend to anyone. I paid \u00a3320 for mine so if they are going for any less, get yourself a pair and enjoy.", "Noise cancelling is a lifesaver, especially if you live in a loud city, and these headphones have the best Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) I could find for this price range.The sound quality is crisp and the response is flat (which is a good thing). The bass is awesome but (PRO TIP) I would highly recommend you download the Sony Headphones app to use with these headphones, and set the connection type from \"Prioritise stable connection\" (default) to \"Prioritise sound quality\" \u2013 it is a game-changer! The app also comes with a whole bunch of awesome features to get the most out of your headphones.Wearing these headphones is comfortable and I particularly like that they fold outwards so you can comfortably rest them on your chest when wearing them around your neck, and they fold up really nicely for when you want to put them away.There's some nifty little tricks, like if you hold your hand up against the earphone it will turn down your music and amplify the outside noise \u2013 which is so handy for when you want to hear a train announcement.There are some strange usability features, like if you set up the Google Assistant (or Alexa) you can no longer toggle the Ambient/ANC/Off mode without using the app, unless you disconnect it again.", "Probably one of the best headsets I've had. Noise cancellation is near outstanding. (A little bit still gets in but unless you're an air traffic controller you don't need absolute blockage.) You can turn them on and wear them just to get some beautiful silence. The battery life is rather great too, not had any low warnings yet, though I do charge mine daily.Sound quality is outstanding. -- Music comes out like you're in a studio, and in games (particularly FPS) you can hear a pin drop let alone creepy footsteps stalking you. (Definitely enable Windows Sonic or similar spatial sound for best impact.)I wasn't sure about the touch sensitive controls but I'm yet to have a mis-touch or wrong command so it must be pretty well implemented.My only wish is that the 3.5mm cable had a 4 pole option so you could use the microphone whilst cabled, as the bluetooth option is not good for gaming (particularly FPS) given the latency involved.I'm yet to try the built-in Alexa or whatever, and I don't need that so probably never will.Very worth the \u00a3275 price point.", "Love these earphones for listening to my audiobooks. The sound is great. They are very comfy and look super. The case that comes them is very good too.... so no need to buy another case. Noise cancellation is very good.... but as I've never had noise cancelling headphones before I've nothing to compare them with. But if you think they will completely drown out very moderate to loud noise near you they don't....eg a few screaming babies on a crowded plane.... they lessened the noise volume but I could still hear the little xxxxs. But they do remove all mild noise outside. I guess it will be impossible to ever have earphones which can completely drown out very loud noise.  But these bad boys are super.Must say I'm not too fussed on the volume and pause (and fast forward, rewind) functions on the outside of the right earphone..... super idea, but it just isn't that smooth. I prefer just pausing on my phone etc.Overall I'd highly recommend them", "Sound quality, sound leak, comfort, and durability are highly important to me for my choice of headphone. I have owned and used many headphones. My most expensive headphone is the Beyerdynamic DT250 80ohm I bought in 2011 for \u00a3149.I returned the Sony XM3 within 30 minutes of receiving and using it. I was disappointed by its sound quality compared to that of the Beyerdynamic DT250. The XM3 leaks more sound on high volume than my DT20. For these reasons, the Sony XM3 isn\u2019t the headphone for me and doesn\u2019t live up to its \u00a3300+ price.I was so impressed by the XM3\u2019s noise cancellation. I almost convinced myself to keep the XM3 for my daily train commute, but I couldn\u2019t because my humble Beyerdynamic DT250 outperforms the Sony XM3 on sound quality, especially on a variety of music genres, clarity, and clean bass. The XM3 leaks out a lot of sound on high volume.", "I use these for frequent travel and in the office.  They work really well, in use for about 3 months now and haven't had any issues with them.  Ear sups can get a little hot against the skin after a lot of use and the noise cancelling is very good but it isn't all noise of course.  Great on a plane but the plug in lead tends to be on the wrong side of the headphones for me, not a big issue as mainly use with Bluetooth which has great performance.If you want a goof quality pair of noise canceling headphones I would recommend these.", "Have tried two pairs now. Both have the same issue with NC mode. Okay for about an hour, but the right ear gives lots of static in it after that. So the noise cancelling just works in 1 ear. Annoyingly worse than my 1000xm2s. If you're after NC Sony failed with these. Not recommended.Update: moved from 1 star to 4 star. These headphones like the 1000xm2 before are great headphones I use for very long time periods. Feel a bit plasticy and creak a little bit, but NC is great, comfortable, sound quality good (I'm not an audiophile though). Just 4 stars, but if they had better quality control I give them 5.", "I got this to drown out my colleague and it works wonders! Best money I've spent for maximum comfort. I use this for meditation as well and it drowns out the drone of the tube nicely! It's so smart, it just knows when you are walking, stationary and on a train and changes the noise cancelling mode to accommodate it so you don't have to manually do it, although that is an option. The controls on the right headset are great! it allows for smooth seamless design that looks good! They are super comfortable, I often find if I wearing headphones for a while, it hurts my ears because it pushes them back, not with these, it allows my ears to sit as they normally would. Just a great product and if the price puts you off, then just know that these are a very well worth it investment!", "I really wanted to like these. The reviews in the press (and here on Amazon) said they were the best (pretty much) and really comfortable...Well, straight off, I found them a bit tight on the head. Maybe this would ease up with use; the ones I tried on a shop certainly seemed more gentle in this respect.Then there was the sound quality. I'm new to 'noise cancelling' - and have to say, in parenthesis, that the noise cancellation is indeed almost miraculous - but I wanted to listen to the music, really, even if screening out other noises was a good thing... and whatever setting I chose, there seemed to be problems.With Noise Cancellation set, there was a strange muffled sensation to the sound. Not that it wasn't clear, but just - well, a bit distant, a bit muffled is the only way I could describe it. Certainly not quite right.Set as 'ambient sound' instead, there was a pronounced hiss.I compared these with some very old-fashioned cheep no-frills wired over-the-ear phones (also Sony, as it happened) and the greater clarity with those was immediately noticeable. I have to admit that if you simply left the 1000XM3s on for a while, you stopped noticing the problems - but that's not quite what one hopes for with a premium product, is it?!I thought them disappointing, and the reviews strangely misleading; for the money, I couldn't live with them, and sent them back.", "I've had my pair for a couple of days now and so I feel pretty confident in assessing the quality of them.I'm just going to get this bit out the way first. Google assistant only kind of works how they say it does. It says that Google assistant can be used via the NC and ambient sound button, which it totally can. But you cannot use that button for switching between NC and ambient sound and still use Google assistant. You have to choose (in the app) which you want. This was disappointing but not a bit issue as when I tried out Google assistant it sucked. I couldn't really tell whether it had picked up what I said and for some strange reason the ambient sound mics are turned on and you can hear your own voice which is a little annoying. Also if you were to use this on a busy road it probably won't hear what you say because of the ambient sound mics being on.My experience with the sound quality is a little different to most people. My reference point for sound quality comes from my HyperCloud XII's and they have truly amazing sound quality, better than almost any other headphones. So when I first put the Sony's on they sounded only slightly better than my other headphones. This isn't bad at all because it really shows just how good the Sony's are because they have slightly smaller drivers and so don't push as much physical air but some how still sound better than my other headphones. So yes they sound absolutely amazing. They sound just as good with NC on, which a lot of NC headphones don't. I can't compare them to Bose's offering as I haven't owned them but I have owned Sennheiser PX 550's and the Sony's sound leagues better than the 550's. Truth be told it's not even close with how much better the Sony's sound.The NC is probably what you're most interested in. The NC on these is, in my best guess, pure witchcraft. They do a fab job of keeping out the world around you and letting you focus on what you need to. I took these out which I drove to get some shopping and they were dangerously quiet. I couldn't hear my engine, the AC, my door close or anything - just pure silence. In busy households or shops they will block out peoples voices really well. They won't completely block voices out but they are quiet enough to the point that once you have music going you won't hear any voices or background noise.The ability to cup your hand over the right earcup to turn on ambient sound if you quickly need to talk to someone now handy. Not much really say about it other than that.They are seriously comfortable to wear. I experienced a little bit of pinching at the top of the head but it was so slightly you forget about it after 10 minutes. This is just a by-product of a thin headband. The pressure isn't distributed as much as say gaming headphones with a much wider band. It's nothing to worry about though. I didn't experience any discomfort from the clamping force on my jaw. My ears get a little warm but only ever so slightly. Not an issue for me.Pairing is super easy on a phone as you just tap the left earcup and boom, they're connected. But, they don't play well when connected to two devices at once. To clarify, you can connect to two devices but audio will only play out the first device connected. To switch from having sound come from your phone to your laptop or PC you have to physically go into settings and click disconnect on your phone. This doesn't mean you have to set it up again on your phone, just means they are no longer connected to you phone. This is annoying as I do this most nights in bed.If you plan to use these with a PS4 then you are Sh*t out of luck my friend. It appears that Sony (on the PS4 end) decided at some point in 2016 to stop supporting Bluetooth headphones on the PS4. So you can't connect these via Bluetooth to a PS4. Sucks but if you already having gaming headphones then it's no biggie.The battery is really good. 30 hours with NC is no joke. Will last a 20+ plane ride.Having USB-C is a god send. It means I can charge my: phone, laptop, earphones and headphones all with one cable.Overall all these are absolutely worth your \u00a3330. I paid \u00a3289. This price went back to normal within a few hours which makes me think it might have been a mistake on Amazon's end. But still, if I had paid \u00a3330 I would still be very happy with them.", "These are the ultimate headphones. If you're looking for a long-term investment in headphones, these are the ones to go for. The noise cancelling is incredible and the features are great. The sound is the best I've heard from any pair of headphones I have tried and I have tried many different headphones from many different brands.Battery life is great, I only have to charge it once a week because I use it purely for the commute to work.More on sound quality, the soundstage is amazing. It feels like you're at a concert. The clarity is at an extreme level.It is extremely comfortable to wear, I can wear it for hours and not feel any strain on my head.The sound controls are good too, once you get used to them you will not be making any errors with changing the volume or changing the song.A couple of negatives are that the microphone for calls is not great at all. But this is so that the microphones can double as a way to listen to the outside of your headphones without having to take them off. So if you do not really care about the microphone, this is the best pair of headphones you can buy under \u00a31000.One more negative is the voice assistant. No matter what you do, it will always notify you with a really poorly sounding voice assistant that you have a received a message and who it was sent from. It is useful at first until you receive multiple messages and it'll keep repeating the notification. Even if you choose to switch it off the stubborness of the app says that \"the notifications cannot be fully turned off\". There is a way around this, but you'll have to look at forums for that.Overall, it is a great pair of headphones. Absolutely recommend it.", "Quite simply.....these are easily the best headphones i have ever used.  I was slightly sceptical if it would live up to the promises on the Sony site, but they do not disappoint. The noise cancellation is excellent, I asked my better half to complain about something.... I activated ANC and within a few seconds..... silence! I did not even have any music on at the time, that alone is worth the money. I use it daily on the underground, and within a few weeks have nearly missed my stop due to not realising i have already reached my destination, I use them in the office, again blocks out all sound when i want to. It has the option to allow ambient sound too, which is a great feature for when you want to hear around you at the same time as music/podcasts etc The ios app is nicely created for managing software updates and configuring sound. It comes with a very nice case that will protect it when its in a bag or not being used.  My only negative is that after a few hour or so, my ears get quite hot, but thats just me i guess, it does not make it uncomfortable,  in-fact i have work it for 4 hours straight without having to adjust it. And its UBS-C - that was a big plus point for me as its one less charger cable i need to carry as i can use my laptop charger at home and work to charge it. And for those who forget to charge it, quick charge gives you 5 hours with just 10 minutes charge... thats crazy! And lastly, it supports Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, however iI have not used that feature yet.", "I purchased these mostly because of having several 10+ hour flights this year. I used them during office hours and commuting - they are incredible for noise cancellation. Especially on the subway, I took them off once and was shocked just how much noise was being cancelled.Furthermore, the sound quality is phenomenal, I listen to music all the time and could tell there was a remarkable expansion over my in-ear headphones from Sony.They are also incredibly comfortable to wear, in total for the average day I wear them from 9 am to 7 pm, I tend to perspire very easily and they never sweated out. This might change in the summer so we will see.I recently had a long haul flight and it was the first time I was able to somehow fall asleep for 10 hours of a 13 hour flight. Mostly due to the noise cancellation offered.The headphones come with a really slick carrying case, which can act as secure storage for the headset, charging cable and flight adaptor.The only issue I have seen is switching between Bluetooth on my PC and my iPhone but this seems more related to bluetooth technologies any anything else.", "Very, very satisfied. Unbelievable for the price. A perfect match/solution for the twin JBL Partybox 100 blutooth speakers I have. Some people criticised the case but I can\u2019t concur: it seems well designed and fits a dream. The head mic is comfortable to dance in. I\u2019ve tested it in a medium size hall and, beyond the slight feedback that you would expect on approaching the speaker, signal strength is very satisfactory. Haven\u2019t yet tested it at the indoor dance-workshop event I expect to use it for but so far I\u2019m smiling and can\u2019t wait to try it out at an outdoors music/dance event also. There\u2019s a tiny bit of lag or latency that I hope won\u2019t be critical and that I can account for in delivering advance instructions in time. Seems a great solution for fitness instructors also. I just the sound lag negligible for what I need it for. I could hardly complain about the quality/price ratio! I took heed of the positive reviews here already and they were 100% on point.", "Having bought the Sony MDR 1NC headphones a few years ago and with more business trips to the US I thought it was a good time to look for a new pair of noise cancelling headphones as I really value them in the plane.Tbh I\u2019ve been sitting on the fence over the last 12 months as I couldn\u2019t decide between the  Sony\u2019s or something different like the Bose Headphones. There wasn\u2019t enough between them however having kept up with the online reviews I started to see the recommendations swing in favour of these pair which triggered ultimately my purchase.I knew the Sony\u2019s were up there in the NC capabilities but  I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be this good. The music quality itself is very bright with enough punch if you like it to be bass heavy. I love the 10min charge via usb c that allows for 5 hours headphone use and the app that personalises your experience. It even measures pressure to determine if you are flying ! Alexa and Google integration is a nice touch and I really like how you can cup the right ear to let in ambient noise, so you don\u2019t need to take them off when speaking to a flight attendant etc. The headphones are light and very comfortable but yet to test on a 10 hour flight (luckily it has a 30 hour duration)Practically- the headphones are now made of plastic to save on added weight, I did however like the old styling with a bit of metal which gave it more premium look.Conclusion - I love these headphones, the NC, clarity and function are beautifully balanced to give you a premium experience in today\u2019s busy world.", "after looking for a pair of headphones i was torn between these and the bose qc35 many utube videos later going through the advantages and disadvantages I went for these...  they look great, the rose gold finishes them off, quite light not to heavy on the head and very comfortable , not finding them sweaty , 3hrs to charge at 1st with a rather short charge cable to say the leadt...but wow worth the wait easy to set up via your phone , download the app, any updates and off you go, the sound is astonishing, the noise cancelling..what noise? you will hear you music only I promise, getting the sensor touch control takes a bit of getting use to if its your 1st pair.", "Noise cancelling is unbelievable.  Sound quality is excellent though I did use the equaliser in the app to improve the treble end, that's a bit flat otherwise.  Fairly comfortable, forgot I had them on once. I think the Bose look a little more discrete but I'm not the generation that wears these things out and about. Only issue is that you have to remember to disconnect one device's bluetooth before you can use another and, as we're sharing these in the family, that's getting annoying, the app Connect button should disconnect whatever is current connected, that would be better. Only being able to connect to one device at a time is a problem when I work as I need phone notifications and skype from my laptop at the same time so I can be in meetings and catch calls at the same time.  The Bose does this so it's just software.  This might become a decider for me as I'm not using them for meetings because of this and that's a big chunk of what I want them for.  There is meant to be a way for phone notifications as well as music from something else but I've not got it to work and I'm in IT.  I'd feel more comfortable if they were 50-100 cheaper as 300 is a lot of money for the convenience of no cables but the sound quality and NC are excellent and better than the Bose (which I tried with a friend's pair).  I wouldn't bother with the wired option, they become quite muffled when working this way.Update: After a couple of weeks using them, the sound quality it excellent and I prefer to listen to music with these on that with my good quality speakers, in fact.  NC is very good.  The biggest problem is bluetooth connections.  It's strong and it doesn't break BUT it's a nightmare connecting to different already-paired devices. Having to disconnect from one before connecting to another is unreasonable, no other bluetooth system insists on that. NFC only applies to phones and doesn't work very often.  I find I have to turn them off, then on and hold for 7 seconds until they think they are repairing, then connect from the new device, this is madness. If it wasn't for the sound quality I would return them immediately.  I find I am spending a couple of minutes messing about, every time I change device. I hope a firmware update will sort this out but I doubt it.", "I got these because of all the great reviews, and I had been searching for a good set of over ear headphones for so long, they were my last hope. However, the sound guality is just not there for me, the ANC is good, they're comfortable, and they don't sound too bad at low volumes, but for high volume listening that bass just drowns everything else out, and trying to fix that with the built in equaliser has just ruined the sound even more. I have had them for 5 days before I gave up, I hoped I could tune them to sound better but every time I change music genre, I need to change the settings again, and for this money it's not worth it.I will say that my problem is the fact I mainly listen to metal music,but they didn't sound bad at all when I tried them in the shop with the demo songs. If you like a strong bass and it suits the music you listen to, then I get the appeal. Just not for heavy metal, hard rock or anytjing like that.I am sad to return them, mainly because now the search for headphones continues..", "I purchased these headphones after trying similar headphones from another company.  The other headphones just refused to pair via Bluetooth, so I wasn't sure these would work.I previously had Bose Quiet Comfort headphones, for several years, but the \"leather\" (protein leather, Bose call it)parts started to break down, in particular the ear cups and headband. The ear cups were replaceable but the headband wasn't.  So it was time to replace my noise cancelling headphones.Quite simply these headphones are brilliant.  They pair easily with any Bluetooth equipment and the app used to control them is easy to use.  Sony have a winner with these headphones and they are certainly better than anything else I have tried.  Headphones are  by their nature, a personal choice.  These are mine and I don't think I made a mistake buying them.", "I bought these as I fly a lot and wanted more comfort, I must say these are brilliant.With the noise cancelling active the loud hum of the air craft is pretty much gone and I can just either enjoy my music on a relaxing low volume or even just pause the music and sit in silence.Ambient sound control is a great feature which I use more often than I thought I would. I work at sea so hearing announcements over the tanoy or announcements on public transport can still be heard whilst drowning out all the other noises that I don't want to hear.These are very comfortable and light, I could easily wear these for hours and not have a sore neck, ears etc.Battery life is amazing, lasts my entire journey pretty much, a whole day of use is great.The headphones app is a very good way to fine tune your sound and experiment with different settings.The carry case is great and just the right size, the controls are easy to learn, and they look fantastic. I'd highly recommend!", "There is not much that I can say that haven't already been said. But. These headphones are a must have especially if you are into your music.Another reason would be to eliminate the outside noise, especially useful in a noisy office environment. I often have them turned on without the music and they kill the background noise and increase my productivity. The air that I breath distracts me - lol.Pros\u2022 Very comfortable and sleek design.\u2022 Outstanding noise cancelation.\u2022 Fantastic sound quality.\u2022 Easy to use app and gesture controls.\u2022 Quick Attention Mode.\u2022 Solid battery life and quick-charge capability.Cons\u2022 Audio quality is only average when the headphones are not powered.\u2022 Small tweaks from 1000XM2.\u2022 Not suitable for gym", "I wanted noise-cancelling headphones as am about to go on a long haul flightand couldn't bear the idea of the normal 'plane and people' noise.  Did a lot ofresearch. Tried on all the top brands. These win on all levels. They are extremelycomfortable and fit me perfectly. The features are great and the noise cancellingis awesome (I've been using it on the tube and it make life so much better).", "I've had Bose Quietcomfort 'cans' for years and I was looking at buying the QC35II. However, I stumbled upon details of these on a website review and subsequently went to listen to them in a local electronics store. Needless to say, I then sought out the best deal - Amazon to the rescue and bought these headphones directly, with a great saving off the \u00a3330 RRP too and with 3 months of Amazon Music Unlimited which I'm currently enjoying very much.I bought the headphones in gold and the case and the headphone cable - used to connect to non-bluetooth devices all match, this doesn't apply to the included charging cable and airline adapter which is a bit of a shame.Anyway, the headphones are, as you'd expect from Sony, exceptional build quality, with a very nicely padded cushion on the top of the pad which rests comfortably on your head. Ear cups are also very comfortable and I've even used these in an office on a very hot day and didn't feel uncomfortable wearing them.There is an on/off switch and NC/Ambient switch on the left headphone cup and that's all you can see. So how do you do other things like skip tracks, turn up the volume etc? Well, these are all very cleverly and very discreetly built-in to the right headphone cup. The exterior surface is a touch-control, you can tap twice to pause, and twice again to resume. Swipe forward from the centre to skip a track, swipe back from the centre to go back a track, go up from the centre to turn up the volume and yes, you've guessed it, swipe down from the centre to turn the volume down. You can even cover the right cup with the palm of your hand to essentially mute your headphones if someone is trying to talk to you and get your attention, and it works really well.Setup is a breeze, turn on Bluetooth (BT) on your phone, turn on headphones and it finds them in the discovered devices list instantly, that's pretty much it.Sound? Yes, headphones are all about the sound quality and the sound from these headphones is QUALITY. You can hear details of your song that you may not hear when listening to the same song on your car system via BT, which in my opinion is what you want with headphones.The app which I downloaded for the iPhone is decent, although I've pretty much left everything as it is as the default sound to me is perfect, there are plenty of options for you if you like to tweak.  You can also update the headphones via the app and a BT connection, just make sure your phone and headphones are well charged beforehand, but you'll get prompted about this by the App when going through the update process.Overall, a quality sounding pair of noise-cancelling (NC) headphones, you will hear voices if people are talking around you nearby if not listening to any content - that isn't a fault of the headphones, just a function of the NC and reading about it you find out that certain high-frequency things like voices aren't cancelled out completely - voices are reduced in volume with NC turned on, but let's be honest, you're most likely going to be listening to music on these headphones with NC turned on, so you'll just be able to concentrate on your music without distractions.", "This noise cancelling headphone is wonderful for music listening specially for me at least. It is very clear, a little more bass but it is very good.Noise cancelling is 7/10 for me. Since I am using Audio Technica for years, most than 10 years, I think. It is very successful for noise cancelling compared to Sony WH-1000MX3. I am comparing very simple, I am opening video containing airplane noise and open the volume till hearing the noise. With My old Audio Technica I am starting to hear around end of mobile phone volume but with Sony I am starting to hear around 70%.Most important problem, phone conversation. This is stopping for me. It amplifies outer sound to other people on the phone. If there is any noise around you like if you are in train, it amplifies all external sound and sends it to other people that the other people can not understand you in some cases or at least create discomfort. I dont understand how Sony makes a such a specification. I told to Sony support and they said that, it is normal behaviour.Do not do software upgrade it makes much more terrible. Thanks for amazon since they have very good service and they accept return of the device two times. At last, I gave up and not return the item.", "I did not expect these headphones to be any good after listening to the WH-1000XM1. I was not sure whether to keep these or not because there isn't enough bass or volume for me personally.I think for most there is enough bass and volume. I have the Beats Studio 2 which I purchased from bhphotovideo and these are louder than if you purchased in the UK.Now I have a solution: Just purchased Creative SoundBlasterX G6 and if you have the latest mobile phone then also purchase Anker USB-C to USB 3.1 Adapter. When you listen to the Sony WH-1000XM3 through the SoundBlasterX G6 amp you won't believe how good they sound. I now have more bass and volume than the Beats. The sound I believe is the best I've heard because of the amp. You won't know how good the Sony WH-1000XM3 can sound until you listen via the Creative SoundBlasterXG6.", "Though I am big fan of Bose systems. Sony WH-1000XM3 headphone blow my mind . This is excellent headphone those who like to listed heavy extra base music.Using app you can control different features of the headphone. Keeping right hand on the headphone allows you to hear other person voice , you don't have o remove the headphone it just amplifies the other person voice so you can hear clear voice.Surrounding system, position of the  sound and once tough Google assistance work excellent. bluetooth connective is just simple and quick to connect.Overall , This headphone is very cool to use, small drawback is you cant keep then too long on your ears it will get moist after some times.Overall, I am very happy with Sony headphone. Sound quality, service, hardware everything is perfectly build with nice design.Very happy!!I would recommend this product.!", "Went from Bose to these bad boys and what a difference! Lovely fit, excellent quality and several gears up in terms of noise reduction and sound quality. Battery life is superb and the app - often the achilles heel of any hardware - is solid and useful. Put them on and listen to the sound of silence...", "Good sound but to be honest I have not really tested this unit out yet.Will get back to this at a later date.One thing which I know will annoy me these cans are over ear they can get very warm and sweaty if left on for long.There are no replacement ment parts cups etc for wear and tear for such expensive cans why not ? Very poor to my mind.Buy a set of bose headphones good sound with replacement parts.I will leave now and come back at a later date to give a full sp on sound and qualityHope this helps", "These headphones are good and I used them as my daily drivers in three situations, which I will breakdown below;- Work- Commuting- GymWorkAround the office these headphones were excellent, with noise cancelling on I couldn\u2019t hear voices, taps on keyboards or the traffic outside. The Bluetooth range is great, I could walk 20m from my desk to the kitchen and still be connected. Putting your hand over the right key cup is most useful in this situation, you can have a quick chat with someone before getting back to the music, it\u2019s surprising how good this feature works.CommuteThe headphones are good on the commute however I did notice some areas where they didn\u2019t perform to well;- On the London Underground I could still hear the tube going along the tracks, this was faint and can counter act this by not playing quiet songs eg; no acoustic.- On the bus if I sat over the engine it would cause a weird vibration of the headphones, not sure what caused this.- If I was standing on the overground and a window was open with winds coming through it would hit the mics and mess up the noise cancellingOther than the above they would be great which was 99% of the time!GymThese were okay but I stopped using them for the gym after a while. Running with these on causes thudding sounds which ruins any music. I ended up getting some cheap headphones for the gymAfter all of that I have returned these headphones because of the build quality. This might not be all of them however the ones I had creaking hinges, this meant any time I slightly moved my heads it would creak and sound like they are about to crack, after 3 months of having these headphones and no drops I wouldn\u2019t expect this. I am going to go in a store and see how the ones there are and may purchase again but keep this in mind, as \u00a3300 for headphones you want them to last!", "I simply don't understand the reviews lauding these headphones as the second coming of Jesus or something. The noise cancelling is good - nothing extraordinary. It's quite poor at filtering out high frequency sounds and decent at low frequency sounds - yes, you will still hear the rumble and clatter of your metro train and yes, it will disrupt your listening experience. Noise cancelling technology still has a few years to go before it can be something you can wow at.The headphones themselves are rather large and bulky. Battery life is excellent, definitely as advertised and the app to go with it works well.I don't believe the 'cold weather issue' is a thing anymore, it seems as if Sony have fixed that.", "Bought it with lots of expectation due to various good reviews. Audio quality is impressive. The iPhone app features are really good. Gesture controls are amazing. Unfortunately, the one that I received had couple of issues, so had to return. It sometimes made me feel a bit dizzy. And there was frequent chimes during which the audio stops for a second. It was a bit annoying especially while you\u2019re on a call. One more minor thing; it is supposed to come with an inflight adapter? that was missing!", "AdorableSpectacularFantasticIrresistibleSplendidAlluringDazzlingFascinatingLovelyStaggeringWondrousWonderfulDelectableFearsomeLusciousStrikingYummyAstonishingDelicateFetchingMarvelousStupefyingAwesomeDelightfulFirst-rateMesmerizingSublimeBeauteousDivineGloriousOutstandingSuperbBeautifulElegantGorgeousProdigiousSupremeBewitchingEnchantingGracefulMagneticStunningAwe-inspiringDeliciousFirst-classSurprisingBeyond wordsEnthrallingGrandRapturousRadiantBlue-ribbonEnticingHeavenlyDarlingThrillingBonnyFabulousIdealRefinedBreathtakingExtraordinaryImpressiveResplendentTranscendentBrilliantExcellentIncomparableSavoryTremendousCapitalExceptionalInconceivableScrumptiousUnbelievableCaptivatingCharmingIncredibleSensualSexyA list of 125+ different words to use instead of \u201camazing\u201dLearn 125+ different words for amazing in English you can use to improve your English speaking and writing skills.AdorableAlluringAlrightAmbrosialAmusingArrestingAstonishingAstoundingAwe-inspiringAwesomeBeauteousBeautifulBewitchingBeyond wordsBlue-ribbonBonnyBreathtakingBrilliantCapitalCaptivatingCharmingClassyCongenialDaintyDarlingDashingDauntingDazzlingDelectableDelicateDeliciousDelightfulDistinctiveDivineDramaticDreamyElectrifyingElegantEnchantingEntertainingEnthrallingEnticingExcellentExceptionalExhilaratingExquisiteExtraordinaryEye-openingFabulousFantasticFar-outFascinatingFearsomeFetchingFirst-classFirst-rateFunGloriousGorgeousGracefulGrandGratifyingGroovyHeavenlyIdealImpressiveIncomparableInconceivableIncredibleInformalInspiringInterestingIrresistibleLavishLikableLovelyLunaticLusciousLuxuriantMagneticMagnificentMajesticMarvelousMesmerizingMonumentalOutstandingOverwhelmingPleasantPreviousProdigiousPsychoRadiantRefinedRivetingSatisfyingSavoryScrumptiousSensualSexyShockingShowySpectacularSplendidStaggeringStrikingStunningStupendousSuccessfulSuperSuperbSupremeSurpriseSurprisingTasteThrillingTranscendentTremendousUnbelievableUnexpectedUnrealUnutterableVery goodWonderfulWondrousYummy", "These Sony NC headphones are the best purchase i have made from amazon, And although it doesn't completely stop out side noise from entering when you are listening to music etc. The sound and the bass are quite something else. I cannot recommend these headphones highly enough. And with black Friday &amp; cyber Monday coming up look out for these if you are after a pair of NC headphones. Top marks to Sony for producing what i would class as the best pair of NC headphone in the market today. highly  recommend them. 5*", "These headphones are simply brilliant, I had the V2s for a while and they were simply amazing too, but these V3s took it a step further especially with sound cancellation. However, if you're looking at value for the price, I'd say get the V2s especially on the current black friday sale and end up with an outstanding seat of headphones for half the price.The only \"complaint\" I have which is nit picking.. Is that I wish you could toggle the gesture controls on/off or lock them because, if you like to sit back with your arms behind your head.. you're going to toggle the quick attention mode.", "I bought these to replace my previous wired Bose n/c headphones which were getting to be a nuisance with too many cables &amp; adapters required for iPhones with Lightning cables and an iPad with only USB-C.  It's also useful not to have to carry one or two spare AAA batteries too.The noise cancellation on these Sonys is fantastic &amp; I find them very comfortable to wear over glasses too, the gestures to change volume / pause / skip tracks are more useful than expected too - very pleased with the purchase.", "These headphones are simply the best for noise cancelling and were the only logical upgrade from my previous WH-1000Xm2 which I gave to my Girlfriend.The noise cancelling is awesome, and sound quality is simply the best. nearly everything I listen too on them sounds perfect. I really cannot fault them.with the addition of Google assistant, they make them useful, reading out notifications.comfortable to wear while walking and while on the train. and cancels out the sound of a train and other fellow commuters!having the touch surface on the right ear is a breeze too use, I simply turn them on let them connect to my phone, I double-tap the right earphone and it wakes Spotify and starts playing whatever I was listening to last.I really can not be any more positive about them.", "Even without playing any music, just switching them on to noise cancelling mode, the sound around you goes from annoying buzzing and humming to eerily quiet instantly.The app is easy to use and gets everything up and running in a couple of minutes and after that, connection via Bluetooth to either of the devices I use it on is quick and solid. They can also be plugged in using the supplied stereo jack plug cable.Glad I took the plunge and bought them as I had been swithering for some time about it.The headphones are comfortable and feel well made.Sound quality is great, music and voice comes through clear and balanced.The supplied carry case is well made and easy to fold the headphones into, with space to store the audio and charging cable as well as the airline adapter (twin mono to stereo jack).", "Great soundBut not at all comfortable on ears for long.Pads very soft and collapse to nothing when worn.Therefore pressure on back of ear (the antihelix).Sore after 20min.Terrible for the \u00a3Also ears get very warm after a short use so that's another strike against the design.ANC works great. Bought to take some of the noise misery out of traveling on the Central Line on the tube. Great for that. Pity about poor design around physical comfort.Now looking for an alternative compatible pad to make the product bearable to wear.Suggestions welcome", "At first I got exceptionally happy with these headphones. The noise cancellation is impressive (obviously it won't reduce all external sounds to zero, but it's enough to isolate you in a cafe for example). The intelligent adjust (it changes between noise cancellation, ambient sound and ambient sound control off depending on what you're doing, e.g. on a bus or walking or running). And finally the sounds is great, you can control the bass, treble and so on using the app and it does make a difference (I'm a heavy metal guy and got satisfied with it).But recently I started having problems with the sensor which is used for gestures control (adjust volume, skip songs, etc). If it's windy of even if it's just very cold, the sensor goes banana and starts triggering Siri (or Cortana, if I'm connected to the laptop). I contacted the support and they told me I need to send to the factory for them to review but my warranty is now over. And it seems it's something that happened to other people in different countries, so it's not a batch problem.So, I still am happy with the headphones overall but unfortunately can't use them outdoors now that the summer is gone.", "Wow, wow &amp; wow again, these earphones are beyond believable!For many years, I have been a Bose QC fan &amp; have owned my QC35s for over 2 years. Then, after reading the Sony review in my Which magazine, I decided to give Sony a try. I only use them when I'm flying long haul with BA so the noise cancellation is of prime importance.And boy do these earphones cancel the external noise. I only received them today but as soon as I had charged them, I started experimenting. The noise cancellation is phenomenal; I was listening to music on my trusty Galaxy S2 on my Sonys &amp; turned the TV audio to level 25. Hardly a whisper came through. The volume control on the Sonys works perfectly, as does the Sony app on both my Samsung S2 &amp; S10.I'm so pleased that I've changed from Bose to Sony &amp; thanks to that auction site, my QC35s have found a new home.", "I tried the wh100x in ear buds, they sounded ok but I kept loosing connection. I then bought the wh900 hear.on2 and they were good enough for me to get the itch and want more....I then bought these and found very little difference. the hear.on2 felt more secure round the ears and sounded nice (\u00a3149), the xm3 had more bass(which wasn't necessarily great) and were slightly clearer but the noise cancelling gave me a hum in my ears (tinnitus sound) which made them unusable (is there such a word) ??? Anyway , that was enough for me to return them and stick with the hear.on2 headphones...Just to add the costs of either headphones are irrelevant, the hear.on2 headphones are imo way better value, like a bit more base then \u00a3179 is what the xm3 headphones are worth, any more don't waste your money", "I came from a half decent pair of wireless AKG headphones when I decided to buy a new pair. I chose these Sony WH-1000M3's as they'd previously won all sorts of awards and I thought, is right, these'll do. The quality of these Sony's surpasses my previous AKG's ten times over!For one, the noise cancellation is incredible! When my sister's kids visit and they're running about making ungodly amounts of noise, I just turn on my new Sony headphones and their shouting and screaming literally drowns out to nothing! These headphones are a God send. I'm no audiophile, but as far as I can tell, the music quality is excellent too and depending on the track you're playing, you can choose a music setting to match.The battery lasts forever and takes no time at all to charge. From zero battery, you can put them on charge first thing of a morning, get ready and dressed and it'll be fully charged by the time you're done. These headphones are sh*t, shower and shave friendly. Charges in no time. Even if the battery dies, there's a long 3.5 jack to insert into the left cup and straight into your phone or media device. I have an app called NatureSpace that plays three dimensional nature sounds such as rain, waves, thunderstorms, etc. and these headphones are perfect for that type of thing!But fellas, be warned. You'll need to turn off the noise cancellation before you use these Sony's to watch adult movies on your phone... I have been caught twice knocking one off because I couldn't hear anyone come in my room. So learn from my mistakes. TURN OFF the noise cancellation when you're about to do your thing! You cannot hear yourself speak, never mind the sound of footsteps coming up the stairs or the sound of your bedroom door opening. Be extra vigilant boys.But as a pair of headphones, these are perfect to listen to music, watch movies or listen to nature sounds. I figured out the other day that they also connect wirelessly to my TV too! Is right!", "These are a great pair of headphones, and my first \u2018serious\u2019 pair. I trawled the web for advice on the best songs to listen to in order to test out new headphones and I tried a range of music and sonic \u2018challenges\u2019. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. The recent software update to incorporate Alexa was the icing on the cake. I went for these over the Bose version. I can\u2019t compare the models since I haven\u2019t tried Bose, but Alexa integration was something that I initially acccepted as a feature I would not get with Sony. Now it\u2019s integrated, I\u2019m very happy.", "I work in an open plan office, and I spend a lot of time with the headphones on. After few months using them I only can say buy them is the best decision I made.I spend a lot of time wearing them as I said, and after trying multiple ones, this ones are the most comforables I ever had.I was looking for a headphones with a good noise cancellation, and again I think they are the best I ever had. No more noise in the office and I can concentrate on my job. Moreover the day I go out to walk without them I figure out how much noise we have outside..The only cons I found is about the touch countrols. Sometimes I miss to have physical buttons... sprcially the raining days, as I cannot put my hood on while I have also the headphones as somtimes the touch control start/stop my music all the time which is annoying.Also the mobile application is really good and the ability to configure the noise cancellation based on your status (quiet, walking, running, ...)  is a really nice feature.I just can highly recommend this ones!", "I haven't put these headphones down since the first day I received them. Put simply, these headphones are the best that money can buy. I have used them for my commute, my music listening, my podcasts and for a recent 9 hour flight. Sound quality is superb and I only have to charge them once a week. The active noise cancelling is downright spooky. The option to cover your right ear cup to have a conversation  works like a dream. I doubt that these headphones can be improved upon for a very long time so for me, this has been a solid investment.", "Love them. use them for travelling. Cancel those annoying screams and shouts from little ninjas in the airplanes, coffee shops, etc. Use them in the underground and at work. Sometime i just use them without music just to zone out if I have to be focused on something.I could write technical details but its on the product specifications.The only down side I would say is the ear getting a bit hot if you wear them for long period of times. But I would say is expected from an over-the-ear headphone.Obviously I would not recommend them for running or expecting to be sweat proof...", "I own the xm2 and gave the xm3 to someone as a present. Safe to say I'm a bit jealous. The xm3 improves massively on the main problems of the xm2, and even improves on features that were already class leading.My biggest gripe with the older version was the resonance in the lows and low miss, causing the sound quality to be quite poor in those ranges. They also lacked energy. These xm3s show no sign of any of those problems. The sound is energetic and powerful, and all frequencies are handled very well. Overall it's quite a warm sound like it's predecessor but with a finesse that makes you fully engage with your music.Noise cancelling is improved (I don't know how, the previous one was already ridiculously good)Looks are improved, with better padding and a more current look (the older model looked a bit weird on the head)Responsiveness of the touchpad is improved.Basically it's just better headphones. Highly recommended!", "I like this product, I really do. It doesn't, however, deserve 5 stars.Pros:- good sound quality- good connection quality- some features in the app, especially the equalizer- good-looking- ANC is amazing- battery life delivers - I now I have a few more hours even when it announces that there's only 10% left.Cons:- poor quality control - before the black ones I've ordered the silver version. I returned them because of headband creaking and \"whistling\" sound with ANC on in one of the earcups. This pair (black) only has creaking and I'm considering returning it.- app on iOS looks and feels like a port from Android- not possible to be connected to two devices - having to go to settings whenever I want to change between iPhone, iPad and PC is annoying.- no USB playback - Firstly, it largely solves issue of limited connections, especially if they would've been able to be simultaneously connected to two devices. Secondly, it would make charging a non-existent problem.- EQ is reset every time I connect to PC - I have to go to the app and switch it back on. Annoying.- plane adaptor feels cheap- software updates take a lot of time- sometimes when I switch from iPhone to iPad (or vice versa) the volume controller goes nuts - I get separate controls for headphones (using the touch panel) and on iOS device.", "When I first purchased this item I was so excited and impressed with the sound quality. Unfortuantely in a couple of months the strap broke, it turned out the material used is really cheap. Also if you are planning to use this headphones with your phone and use it's mic for phone calls etc. DO NOT. It is terrible for that and believe me you'll end up carrying a second set of headphones just for phone conversations. My previous headphones were Bose and I really regret changing the brand.", "These headphones are simply amazing. I work in am open plan office, and struggle to focus at times because of everything else going on. As soon as I put these headphones on, the background noise pretty much disappears, and as soon as I play some light music I really am in my own zone.The noise cancellation is of course not perfect, but it is really good! The sound quality is fantastic. I've watched a couple of movies with these on and heard some of the subtleties of sound that I have never heard through conventional speakers, sound bars or the cinema. Simply amazing and immersive.The only thing I have found, is that these get a little too hot to wear if using while on the move. That isn't to say it is impossible to wear them out, but I tend to march and get a little too hot wearing them. I imagine they're great for commuter trains, air travel and the like. They could be potentially dangerous when walking and crossing the road however. Drowning out traffic is never a safe move!", "These headphones are amazing. I\u2019m coming at these from an iPhone EarPod upgrade, so it\u2019s like going from a Nokia 9910 to an iPhone overnight. Love the sound quality, so much clarity for all types of music and podcasts. The EQ option can really make a difference. The noise cancelling is mind blowingly good. It can\u2019t cut everything out but what it does cut out is more than enough. I think the longest I\u2019ve worn them is 4 hours straight. They\u2019re so comfortable but my ears did need a rest after that. If it was a flight I\u2019m sure I could stick it out for longer. I spent about 4 months procrastinating about whether to buy as they are pricey but now I have them I am not regretting this purchase. Hope you enjoy your pair.", "I bought these headphones 3 months back as I was commuting to training courses and sharing rooms with class mates and thought they'd be good while traveling and in my down time.The noise cancellation is fantastic, it removes the low end completely but they're not perfect, no matter how many times I optimised I'd still hear voices, and sounds on the higher spectrum, but nothing is perfect.I was quite taken back by the sound quality, as for the price I didn't think the sound was that good, in comparison to my AKG 92. But over time I've gotten used to them. They just seem to focus on the low end compared to the high end, and as such I've found some songs such as Cafo by Animals as Leaders sub par in comparison to the cheaper set of studio headphones as pre mentioned and my basic bedroom sound system.Bluetooth works perfectly with both my OnePlus 3 and Galaxy S9, as well as my Laptop. However when going into the app on a number of occasions it tells me that the device isn't connected, which is solved by reconnecting, just a little annoying when you want to adjust the EQ. Just wish I could connect multiple devices at once as it favours my phone over my laptop, and I have to resort to using the cable sometimes.Love the swipe guestures and the hand cup to mute, I've used it a lot when in the office and it works great.All in all, solid pair of headphones, but I don't think it was worth what I paid.", "I used these on a commute to central London to filter out train noise and they were remarkably good. I could see people talking but not hear them. Lifting the cup from my head revealed  the deluge of noise that was being filtered out. They are also really comfortable and from now on any travelling listening will be with these.  There is much functionality here I have not exploited. My only criticism is the start-up app, which has an essentially blank screen with a start button at the bottom, but this cannot be reached on my Galaxy view, with pops up a system tray over it, so it is impossible to start the app.  Put the button in the middle of the empty screen and it would be fine.", "These headphones are excellent, I purchased them as I'm going away in June and needed noise cancelling while flying to drown out the airplane noise. Little did I know just how good the sound quality was, I've used these at least once everyday and I've had them 2 months. I have a noisy household, 2 kids and nagging wife. Escape has rarely been an option but these have changed all that. They're expensive but so is everything these days, however rarely do we ever get what we pay for. Finally I have with these little beauties. Bass is booming if that's what you like, trebles are clear but never ear piercing and the vocals are brilliant. The headphone app is good but I find that turning the bass down a notch and keeping everything flat straight across the middle ( sound equaliser) gives the best sound. Awesome purchase, recommended.", "Generally a good product. However when using these headphones on an aeroplane the sound cancellation did not muffle as much sound as I was hoping and I could still hear babies crying a few seat in front of me. The other problem is that the touch controls on the right ear up can sometimes be a bit unresponsive and can require multiple gestures for your intended action to take place. However they still have very good sound quality and are generally good headphones. Overall I would say they are good but not worth \u00a3270. More \u00a3200", "Bought these to replace my Bose QC's, which had worn out after a couple years of wearing over glasses.The noise canceling on these is great, better than the Bose ones. Unfortunately these are worse than my old headphones in a few other ways:- the sound is a little bass-heavy for my taste- USB-C charging is just a mess, my USB-C OnePlus charger won't charge these- they're a little less comfortable for prolonged use- they will only connect to one device at a time. If I want to switch from watching a video on my laptop to taking a call or something on my phone, then I have to futz around disconnecting it from one device and reconnecting it to another.Overall I'll keep using these, but unless some of these issues are improved on, I'll switch back to Bose for my next pair.", "I have normally used in-ear headphones but fancied a change mainly because I was looking for better sound quality, in particular the reduction of background noise. I listen to podcasts and shows involving a interviews, documentaries etc and so it was important for me to have a set of headphones with which I could clearly hear the spoken words. These headphones (Sony WH-1000XM3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones) are perfect for this requirement. On tube trains (including what was recently assessed as the noisiest line in London) the sound quality is crystal clear. I have never missed a word.I also like to listen to music (again when on public transport) so sound quality for me is also important from a music perspective. I have not come across any issues with these headphones at all when listening to my favourite bands. I've read elsewhere that the bass is not great, but I am totally satisfied with the quality of the bass and treble.In terms of connecting to my iPhone - there are not problems at all. It connects really quickly and the controls are nearly instant.I have given this five stars as I really cannot fault them at all.", "Having finally upgraded from my reliable Bose QC15s I cannot believe I didn't make the decision sooner. I'd grown tired of cables being tangled and having to use a dongle with my iPhone but in all honesty the difference in noise-cancellation alone is worth it.These headphones also provide comfort for hours, brilliant sound and build quality, all alongside superb battery life. The app for iOS and Android is a great partner and allows you to adapt the level of noise-cancellation to your surroundings and movement, as well as allowing you to adjust the EQ to your personal taste.The only negative, in order to provide an objective review, would be the need to pair the headphones each time you switch device as there is no ability for the headphone to remember two separate devices. This really isn't a significant inconvenience as holding down a button for 5 seconds is a simple enough process. I would hope Sony will consider rectifying this in a future firmware update, if the hardware allows for it.Ultimately I could not recommend this product highly enough.", "Absolutely amazing headphones, NC is superb tried it on many long haul flights and it has worked every time flawlessly. I compared them side by side with Bose qc35 II Andy tu Jose were flat in comparison.  They are very confortable and sit lovely on the ears.  The sound signature is everything you want it you are in to hip hop and rnb v shape with a brilliant bass and solid treble. The vocals are  also nice and clear. Overall really impressive headphones with great sound.", "Being one of the first wireless headset's I ever owned I am pretty pleased the way they have been since getting them. You do pay for quality. I am disappointed about the noise cancellation system, I am happy when your listening to music you can't here anything, but its not a two way system like a cheaper \u00a330 headset. Eg, you won't be able to hear anything, but when you crank up the volume, the noise can be heard from people around you. I was hoping, that the headset had a dampener for the people around you as well.  Aside from that, the battery life is great you get a solid 8hrs+ of battery life and charging takes around 1hr+. So would recommend charging when your asleep save the hassle of waiting.I love the payment system of Amazons by monthly as well. They do give you email notifications when they are about to process the payment, so you can be well prepared. All in all, being a first time Sony headset product owner, its a good shout of a headset for new wireless buyers!", "I\u2019ve only ever had a standard set of Marshall headphones and Beats Solo, but these headphones beat them hands down.I\u2019ve never had noise cancelling headphones, and I thought that they were a bit of a gimmick, but I\u2019m amazed how effective these are. Was in a busy and noisy train station the other day, and couldn\u2019t hear a thing except the music that I was listening to.Audio quality is amazing, they are very durable and not too heavy on my head. The iOS app is really useful as well and adds customisability, such as different audio effects and listening to the music from different \u201cangles\u201d which is all really cool.Overall, exceptionally happy. Well worth the money and beat my others, easily.", "I bought these a couple of months ago and I\u2019m sorry to say I had to return them shortly after and here\u2019s why;I\u2019ve never found over ear headphones very comfortable after long use and the Sony wh-1000xm3 fell into that category which was an absolute shame. The noise cancelling on the headphones are absolutely breathtaking, i absolutely loved blocking out all my surroundings and just mellowing out for an afternoon.The sound quality is stunning simply amazing, it has the bass, treble and a magnificent soundstage. The app can be buggy at times but it works well pairing and changing the equalizer on the fly. Battery life is unrivalled, didn\u2019t need to charge it after days of use, it\u2019s that good.My downside was the comfort, a lot of people will love how these feel when wearing them, I just couldn\u2019t get used to them. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting the wf-1000xm3.I\u2019ve rated them 5 stars as they deserve it, but in my case they weren\u2019t the ones for me. But that shouldn\u2019t detract from the fact that these are astounding headphones.", "I had a pair of the Sony M2 headphones and was very happy with the sound quality, noise cancelling and comfort of those. These M3 headphones are even better. They're not just a tweak of the M2, they're a genuine step forward. I've used them on several long haul flights and they're fantastic, especially when you're wanting to get some rest and want to shut out the sounds of the plane and fellow passengers. My only minor gripe is the shortness of the headphone charge cable which makes plugging it into a travel adapter plugged into a wall socket a bit of a challenge. Overall though, I'm well chuffed with these M3 headphones!", "These headphones sound great when noise cancellation isn't engaged but once it is I get a faint white noise sound which is really annoying especially when listening to quieter pieces of music. Furthermore the left headphone developed a louder interference noise after a couple of days of use which was there even when it wasn't coupled to my phone. The headphones are nicely built but at this price I don't expect background white noise or any other interference so have returned these for a refund (Amazon customer service excellent as always).  Also, the touch controls on the side of the headphones are a complete waste of time. They should use buttons and not an unresponsive and often flakey touch system.", "Noise cancelling headphones are a constant staple in my day to day functioning. I\u2019ve had a pair of Bose QC35i for the past year and decided to move to Sony\u2019s offering when the right earpiece of my Bose stopped functioning.The 1000XM3 are a fabulous piece of kit. They look stylish. They feel expensive. The noise cancellation is fantastic and I agree with most reviews that it probably edges out the Bose to become first in class. The sound is punchy, clear and has plenty of bass. I am no audiophile but for me they are a delightful listening experience.Why then am I going to return them for a new pair of Bose QC35?The lack of multi-point Bluetooth connection is an absolute deal breaker for these headphones. My old Bose (2016 tech if I\u2019m not mistaken) could connect to both my phone and my iPad or laptop simultaneously. When finished playing music on my phone I could pick up my iPad and start playing media there and the connection would switch seamlessly and vice versa.The Sony headphones are noticeably and unfortunately lacking in this regard.When switching from phone to iPad/laptop I have to manually disconnect from one device and pair to the next. While this doesn\u2019t sound like a big issue, you only realise how many times per day you swap devices when you have to manually reconnect your headphones each time!! This is at best mildly irritating and at worst hugely frustrating as the pair/repair process isn\u2019t always quick or instant on the Sony headphones. I\u2019ve had them for a week now and it really is irksome and I am most definitely not alone, a quick google on the subject will show thread after thread dedicated to peoples frustrations with this.For me, therefore, these headphones get 3 out of 5 stars. Switching between devices is a huge part of my workflow and leisure time. In this regard these headphones just can\u2019t keep up where the Bose had no issue. For other people this might not be that much of an issue, but for me it has been a deal breaker.So, despite the sexy appearance, class leading noise cancellation and clean listening experience these headphones are going back to amazon and I\u2019m going back to Bose!", "Great sound quality, great noise cancellation and nice build quality.  Unfortunately I had to return mine as it gave me headaches, inner ear pain, neck pain and made me feel dizzy if noise cancellation was used for more than about half an hour at a time.  I also tried a Jabra Evolve 75 headset.  This just gave me ear ache but the ANC was not nearly as good.  I'm think my physiology is just not compatible with ANC and will be sticking to a passive noise isolating setup; in-ear monitors / earphones with comply foam tips.  These are maybe half as good at noise cancellation as the Sony WH-1000XM3, which honestly are pretty incredible at muting a train journey and the hum of an open plan office.", "Absolutely awesome set of headphones. I used to use my studio headphones to listen to music, and they were supposed to be noise cancelling but I was actually shocked how much the Sony blocked out sounds of the outside world. Fell into a deep trance listening to pink Floyd on the plane and actually forgot I was 35000 feet high. Volume control is annoying sometimes but I usually just keep it on full and control via phone or music device.", "I researched these to death and was truly excited to buy them. The quality shines out, the reviews across the board incl Which? are stellar.BUT - the noise cancellation, whilst incredible, can cause some major issues for a small number of people including me.Within ten mins of putting them on (and the fit and comfort is great) my throat starts to feel thick as if I've got laryngitis coming on, my ears completely block like the worst plane air pressure and a headache starts. This continues for literally hours after wearing them for only 10 mins and is truly horrible.I searched and searched online to find some mention of this in case I had a rogue pair and found the answer on Reddit - a whole thread of people with the same symptoms.For full disclosure, I also had the same experience with Apple Airpod Pros (also beautifully designed with great sound and ANC) - and the Reddit thread was full of people struggling with all ANC, so if you've tried other brands with success you'll be fine with these and should buy them.So in summary - absolutely agree with the 5 star reviews everywhere as long as you've not got a problem with ANC in which case they are unusable .SOLUTION - try them in store first and for a decent amount of time.", "Pros:\u2022 Great noise-cancellation. I've literally had to learn to be more careful when cooking, brewing coffee, etc because I can't hear things with these on anymore. Also, I couldn't even hear the data centre servers when standing in an aisle.\u2022 Great sound and customisation. I've heard so many new little details in songs that I've never noticed before and the app gives you quite a bit of control - I love bass so my favourite equaliser is \"CLEAR BASS\".\u2022 Great battery. It literally lasts for days and only takes a few hours to recharge fully.\u2022 Great controls. The touch-sensitive right-hand speaker is so useful for pausing and resuming, switching track, changing volume, invoking the intelligent assistant of the host device, etc. The option to decimate volume and passthrough microphone input by placing your hand over it is otherworldly cool!Cons:\u2022 At least for my ears and glasses, the left speaker can start to hurt after a few hours.\u2022 The option to easily switch between Bluetooth-connected devices like my iPhone and PC would be nice.\u2022 The touch controls' sensitivity are a bit inconsistent - sometimes you can clear double-tap but nothing with happen and other times you'll pause your music, take them off, and they'll start playing in your hands.\u2022 The microphone isn't amazing.", "I have tried Bose 700, I have tried the over rated Nuraphones and wasn\u2019t blown away , I saw that the Sony 1000mx3 were No1, I always assumed Bose should be No1, they were not, the Sony 1000mx3 really are the best sounding headphones available, noise cancellation and sound quality are through the roof, I listen to Bob Marley and love every detail of the album , I\u2019m so fussy and I\u2019m always wanting the best , the voice calls are not great .. sort it sony, but NC, battery life and sound quality are 100%, look for the deals, you can get for \u00a3240, still expensive but you'll love them , no I wasn\u2019t paid to review , these deserve it .", "I brought these headphones and the noise cancelling is where they excelled. This was because why using  them on the train it blocked out the very annoying sound of the train, people voices and the announcements were muffled until you turned on the ambient sound then you can hear some sounds.The touch screen for the volume and changing music and other things was a bit annoying for me as it was hard to get use to but they were fine but I prefer physical buttons. The sound quality was great espically how you could alter the sound deleting on the phone app, you need the app to use the noise cancelling and ambient sound as there is a button for that.However I returned them because they got hot after long use, and I am not surethis happens to everyone but my ears hurt after using the noise cancelling for a long time. I returned them because of these reasons and because of how expensive they were. But otherwise a great pair of headphones.", "For those of you reading you have most likely already done your research so I can assure you this is *the* one at the time of writing. Taken on a Ryanair flight with kids everywhere and adults talking - all turned to silence at the press of a button. I can assure you there is nothing better available then this in noice cancellation for the time being. The flight was almost 5 hours and there was no issue with comfort or ears heating up as claimed in some videos. Of course it matters from person to person but for me personally there is no issue with heat and comfort for long durations. Sound is also subjective but that's why you have a great equaliser to set it to your preferences with many options to please everyone.", "After a month using this at least 7 hours a day I can say that those headphones are:- Comfortable- Excellent sound quality ( we're not talking about SHURE headphones or even professional tools, no need to get pedantic )- Noise cancelling is quite impressive, I use it in transports and at work ( work place can get busy/noisy ) and I can fully focus on my code.- Fast charging is NOT A LIE, it charges really well, and quick, only downside : the length of the USB-C cable is seriously small, tripling the size of it could have helped.- The transport carrier is good, looks nice, and I appreciate the extra connectivity for planes.I love the 'Silver' colour, even my partner made a weird face when I told her 'Yeah I took the Silver ones' she would have preferred black, but got surprised by how good they really looks !Overall it is good. I may update the score after a few months of usage.", "The headphones are well built, &amp; comfortable when worn for extended periods. The noise cancellation is one of the best in the industry, and the additional compensation for atmospheric pressure through the app allows for an enhancement experience. Audio clarity is extremely good, with balanced highs, mid ranges and low frequency response.The app additionally allows settings for different situational effects, like concert hall, etc., plus a wide range of equalisation options.C port charging is a boon..10 minutes of charge allows for a few hours of usage time, which is possibly the best in the industry yet.The headphones are a bit on the pricier side, but in my opinion, well worth the price you pay!", "These are my first NC headphones. They are brilliant. Just switching them on makes you realise how much background noise is going on all the time that you take for granted.They are easy to set up, comfortable, a reasonable weight and have excellent sound quality. The touch pad on the right can is simple to use and second nature after a few attempts. I was hoping to use them for running but they might be a bit too heavy for that. Walking? No problem.I still think they're expensive (\u00a3330 when I got mine) but as soon as you put them on, you know where the money has gone. Can't recommend enough.", "Ohhhh that's what it's supposed to sound like! I've only had these one day and want to listen to my entire music collection all over again. Been using in-ear headphones, from cheap to very expensive, for years but already I'd struggle to go back. Noise cancelling is superb, plane noise is gone, app is simple but includes great surround and EQ options, touch controls are super easy and the 'cup the earphone to temporarily cut sound so you can talk to people without removing the headset' function is brilliant. It's like I've finally procured the Sony Budukans of Massive Attack legend ;)", "It's said to be the best noise cancelling headphone on the market. Well, in some aspects it is. It can filter out most vehicle noises (car, bus engines, road noise) and does a decent job with city noises. Also, works suprisingly well with cancelling the irritating techno music blasted by irritating neighbours. It's not perfect though. Airplane engines are a bit too much to handle, although it helps a lot. The pads are closed and don't ventilate at all, which can be unpleasent after some time. Build quality could be better, it sometimes makes noises when I'm walking or turning my head.I didn't measure battery life, but it's a lot. Certainly 20+ hours. Also charges fast due to the USB C. Sound quality is an interesting thing, when it's wired and not turned on, it doesn't sound good. But if you turn it on, then some DSP magic happens and it sounds a lot better. Gesture controls take some time to get used to but they work well. The app that comes with it is OK.Overall, it's good but not perfect. I wouldn't buy it for full price, but it can be a good offer when it's on sale.", "Holy crap, these are stellar. You might be thinking \"why would I spend so much on headphones?\" and that would be a valid thought. But if you can, go to your local electronics shop and see if they have these and try them for yourself. All my mates are blown away by the noise cancellation and sound quality. Also, it pairs fairly quickly to my Mac and iPhone. I rarely touch my m50xs these days. Yup, that good.", "I use these headphones daily to listen to audio from my PC and they work very well. Good audio and build quality. One charge tends to last me 4ish days of pretty heavy use. These are the first pair of noise cancelling headphones I've used so I can't compare them to anything but I've worn them for car journeys and all outside noise is removed. Overall, if your looking for some of the best NC headphones currently available and don't mind forking out a load of cash for them, these are for you.", "These earphones are excellent , i bought them to replace my older bose ones and have been pleased from the start. Excellent all round sound with good non exaggerated bass and top end, the noise cancelling is also the best I have used, great for plane travel and noisy children! - it comes with an app and this has its good and bad side, you can adjust equalisation and noise cancelling characterisics but it can be a bit fiddly to use. The only downside is changing from my iPad to iPhone as the connections don't release without turning ble off on the one not being used. It would be great if there was a change over button for this , the app has a change device button but this is not always successful .", "Nice sound, outstanding noise cancellation, outstanding battery. Touch controls are distinctly average (physical would be better) as you can miscontrol if it brushes your shoulder (Gym vest) - I.e. any kind of skin (it\u2019s also a little finicky and unresponsive on occasion). No big deal I control with my phone and can turn off the touch controls (but physical buttons would still be better). pretty comfy but you can feel the weight on your crown (noticeable but not a massive issue) - I feel the Bose are more comfortable (headrest and earcups).  Overall very happy despite these minor points - the sound, noise cancellation, and battery is stellar - comfortable enough to wear for extended durations (even if not quite as comfy as some), and the fact you can use these with the audio jack only and not need to turn them on (as long as you are cool going without ANC when doing so) is a really great feature. The app and its eq settings are useful too. Highly recommend ;)", "Great app with lots of features. Noise cancelling excellent. But... we have headphones to listen to music and this is where it goes wrong. The clear bass feature was anything but. I tried using the app to sort it but never got anything less than muddled, and confused bass. (I was using flac high res source via Bluetooth 3). I returned them next day &amp; Amazon refunded quickly - nice one amazon.", "Love them, but compared to my WH-1000XM2, I only love them as much as I love my older model. The difference is nowhere near as noticeable as the product description made me believe it was. The one thing I did notice most was that this model has more padding on the top compared to the previous model. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they are great and you should definitely get them if they\u2019re your first pair; but they\u2019re not significantly better than the previous model.", "Done some research prior get this one, as a bit pricey, but there are lots of features on this item, and I guess it only fair to pay for them. Some of them just too much for my mind to understand. I just wanted something that delivered excellent sound, with sleek design and great material quality. Good enough for me. I would recommend.", "I had the previous version of these headphones (WH-1000XM2) and loved them so much that I wore them nearly everyday when at my desk, so when these were released I thought I would upgrade to the latest version after reading all the positive reviews.I'm pleased to say the reviews are all correct, the sound quality is a big jump forwards from the last version and the noise cancellation is now better than the Bose, which my wife owns.The big disappointment for me, and the reason I had to return them, was that they were incredibly uncomfortable and would pinch the top of my head leaving me with a headache after wearing them for a short amount of time. I persevered over the course of a month hoping that I would break them in and they would get more comfortable but I'm afraid they didn't improve so had to go back.I'm massively disappointed as the previous version didn't have this issue but no matter how much better the new ones sound I just couldn't keep them. I'm now on the look out for a new pair but might wait until an updated version of these come out", "Weather they are value for money is a personal choice . But they are very comfortable . The sound is good , I wouldnt say exceptional . There is probably a reason much more expensive studio headphones are the price they are. These are good all -rounders . Controls for me work ok . Battery v good . App also ok .  They connect well to some devices my less expensive headphones had trouble with . Have used mainly at home so haven't given a full test run but overall I'm glad I bought them . It's like you aren't blown away but at the same time your reluctant to take them off or use other headphones in the house.", "I was torn between these and the Bose Q700's. Overall the price point of the Sony's was approx \u00a3260, and the difference in price and the quality delivered sealed it for me. The noise cancellation is better than Bose in my opinion having tried both. The sound quality delivered is good to excellent. The bass is great, although the mids are a bit muddled sometimes. The touch controls work really well once you get dialled in to them. The only draw backs for me are the single bluetooth pairing, and the degradation in codec quality when using a custom noise shaping.The Bose are also excellent, but the features offered for this price are great.", "Like:Noise cancelling works superbly.Being able to switch between sound modes (ambient, etc.) when you need to hear something in real world.Sound quality is simply sublime.Build quality.Comfort - very comfortable, never fatiguing. Even when my glasses are on my face, I can listen for long periods.Fast charging and battery life so far impressive..To improve:The swipe function for volume and changing track can be easily muddled. Haven't got the hang of it yet.Conclusion:Early days, but providing they last for a while, they are a decent investment, increasing enjoyment of music.", "Unfortunately, I had to return my Sony's. There were 3 problems for me:1) Ear overheating.I initially thought that it would be nice to have a pair of over-ear headphones to keep my ears warm in winter, but because Iwalk fast on my commute, my ears were getting too warm.2) Bluetooth dropouts.These seemed to mainly occur when first playing something, and especially so on the tube, but they were too frequent to ignore. This was on the \"strong connection\" setting.3) Volume changes when going through tunnels on the train.My train journey includes tunnels that the train goes through pretty quickly and there is a significant air pressure change when it does so. This seems to throw out the noise cancellation and causes the volume to go up and down again quite sharply.Any one of these I could probably have lived with for the amazing noise cancellation, sound quality and comfort of these headphones, but ultimately they were just not for me.", "My son has these headphones  on his ears 24/7..... hes very happy with these headphones so  obviously getting my moneys worth... i thought omg they were expensive!!!!! ...but of course buying these my son has QUALITY....cheap headphones damage your hearing....these of course are not damaging my sons heating as like i have already said he wears them 24/7 ....there is also many functions on these geadphones that are not available on others...if you need a good quality set of headphones then buy these...you wont regret it ...i am sure my son will get many tears of enjoyment from these....so would you if you huy them ..thank you seller..", "The charging cable is very short and you will probably need to buy a longer one but, apart from that. these are the best headphonesI have ever known. They are light, its almost more comfortable wearing them than not! I cannot speak too highly of them, definite out perform Bose and the battery life is up to 30 hours. Orderd them and they arrived the next day. Highly recommend.", "Yes these are expensive... For a reason. These are the best sounding noise cancelling headphones available. They are comfortable, come with all you need (apart from a 3.5mm to standard jack adaptor) and seem to have an incredible battery life. You need to download the Sony app to get all the functionality but that is worth it when you can control just about everything. Sound quality is amazing and my only issue is the sweat that arises when these are worn for a while or in hot places. Worth the money? For sure when nowadays most listening is via smartphones rather than hi-fi speakers.", "I had the NAD Viso HP70 but suffered a lot of weird issues (whining/whistling noise, dropouts, poor sound quality, uncomfortable headband). A friend rocks the Sony's and swears by them. I don't often write reviews, but these headphones are game changers. Finally a bluetooth headphone that has it all: Great ANC, great controls, super comfortable, and a great sound. I've worn them for hours in the last few days, and sometimes forget I am wearing them. The noise cancellation is almost up there with Bose QC35, but everything else is way better, so as trade offs go, there are almost none to make. These win.", "I have been looking for high quality NC headphones for months.I always liked bose in ear QC 30 NC headphones for low ear warming and being able to use for long hours but they almost unusable for phone calls.Then i tried QC 35 ii, many ppl may like it but they are not for me - i couldn't even wear it for more than few mins as I was feeling pressure inside the ear which was unbearable.I did some research and understood that some ppl get this ear pressure issue - then thought will try my luck sony wh 1000 xm3.I don't feel any in ear pressure like i did with QC 35 ii and phone call quality is good as well if not excellent.Noise cancellation and audio quality far superior than QC 30.Thanks amazon for the amazing return policy - allowed me to exchange with this set while taking payment for the difference amount.", "Basic functionality like taking calls is terrible, and bad bluetooth pair connection management, you can only connect one device at a time. Simple market research would show you that even bluetooth speakers at 100+ euros (quarter the price) have the ability to pair with multiple devices at the same time, yet obviously play only one source at a time.At this price range, there should be no room for cheap parts and/or firmware.Two stars are for the sound quality, noise cancellation, and amazing battery life...", "I've not owned a pair of headphones like this before, I've previously only paid something like \u00a330 for some Sony earbuds a long time ago. So this was a significant purchase for me.I'm very happy with them!They are firstly very comfortable. The noise cancelling is also very good, trains have become very quiet.The touch features are very nice too. Changing volume, tracks and the feature that lowers the volume and feeds in ambient sound work great.I only give 3 stars for the \"gaming\" criteria as they don't have the usual usb communication for mic and sound that dedicated headsets would have. But I don't think it's an issue, these are not designed for gaming, but for travel.", "I have the Bose, an I can confirm that it has far superior noise Cancellation, I have tested it outdoor s without music an its absolutely fantastic how the noise Cancellation does what it does with the QN1 chip.The sound quality is fantastic also playing hi res files wired is superb even using wifi with LDAC is wonderful, they are worth every penny, you'll have no regrets purchasing these head phones an I am a audiophile,  buy them .", "Excellent for airplane travel / any kind of continuous noise.The ability to turn off sound cancelling temporarily by placing your right hand over the right headphone is super useful. Sound is great, not seinheisser 660s... ;) but very good for the style / feature set this headphone is designed for.The app is pretty smart but you don\u2019t need it, it has a pretty smart feature which will allow certain kinds of noise through the noise cancellation depending on what you are doing, for example if sitting still it\u2019s on maximum, but if you are walking it detects this and allows certain frequencies that might be useful to hear (such as cars) as you walk around. Of course, this is all configurable so it\u2019s cool!", "I tried the Bose Quiet Comforts and sadly had to return them due to Bluetooth irregularities. Now these bad boys tick all boxes with one exception. The swipe controls. Great if you like it, but I\u2019m not a fan. Bose have the upper hand with actual buttons, on that one. That aside, I love these. They\u2019re good looking and sound great. They\u2019re comfortable and the Bluetooth connection is fantastic.", "Touches my ears when I wear them which causes my ears to hurt during medium-long periods. I don't have particularly large ears and when I checked online, a lot of people seem to be having this issue. The ear cups are very low-profile which looks great but at the cost of massive discomfort, it isnt worth it.I was really looking forward to these and the sound is great but I think I might have to switch back to Bose after-all =(PS: The volume control is annoying to use. Every swipe gives you 3% instead of a nice gradual increase on swipe like they have on Bose 700.", "Moved from some Bludio to these and boy oh boy what a step change in sound quality and comfort.The sound is so good and the noise cancellation is so good that you are immersed into a whole new world of sound. Absolutely amazing.I can see why they're so expensive now, but it's worth it. Go on treat yourself and get them you really won't be disappointed with your purchase.The only thing is DON'T do the latest firmware update from Sony, because as many users have said it changes the noise cancellation for the worse, so leave them as they are until they remedy it. Just as I will.", "Honestly, I don't think I could go anywhere without this headphones now if I need some quiet or even silence. I even bring it to the library or when I'm travelling overseas or even when I'm at home with my parents. It blocks out so much noise and the sound quality is AMAZING. I personally like hard beats in hip-hop/R&amp;B/pop songs and this translate very nicely. It's not overbearing that it ruins the sound quality either.The battery life is pretty decent for a bluetooth headphones too and it's pretty comfortable to wear. Although, the Bose QC35 is still more comfortable in my opinion, these aren't that far off. The sound quality and noise cancelling ability is better on the Sone WH-1000MX3. Also, I think it looks much more sleek and in trend in comparison to Bose's industrial look. The app is a little bit gimicky, I'm not going to lie - and the adaptive ambience mode could be tweaked with app updates though I don't think it's that essential that it detracts from the quality of the headphones overall.In all, I love these headphones.", "Been using the headphones for about a month.Pros:The sound quality is fantastic and the noise cancelling is the best in the business no questions there.They are compact and light.The quick attention mode on the touchpad and volume/play/pause are easy to use.The app is useful and works well with the headphones.Integration with google assistant and the notifications on my phone is brilliant (Samsung galaxy S7 edge)Cons:I sometimes find it hard to wear them comfortably for long periods of time.It's annoying to fold them up everytime you put them in the case, feels like this will eventually lead to a mechanical failure. Changing between Bluetooth devices could be much easier.The case inside feels lower quality than you would expect for the price.The touchpad can be a little annoying at times (fast forwarding a song I have never managed).Overall I would give 4 stars. I bought them for the sound quality and noise cancelling and they do not disappoint. All the other features are a bonus, so I can forgive some things but not enough for 5 stars when you consider the price.", "Bought these to replace my old BOSE Qc35's and can say they were definitely worth the upgrade.Sound quality is superb and pairing these alongside the app gives you so much flex to change settings based on what you are listening to.Noise cancellation is where these are far superior to the Bose...completely cancel everything out, Iv used them in my office, on a train and whilst out walking and they are excellent.Comfort and fit is probably on par with the Bose and I have worn these for 5+hrs with no fatigue or issues.Only downside and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is the bluetooth switching. These headphones will only connect to one device at a time which coming from the Bose which allows 2 devices is a little letdown and a slight inconvenience when I switch from my laptop to phone and vice versa as you need to disconnect and reconnect - yes not life changing but feels like a basic change that would push these to 5 starts IMHO", "Love these headphones. They block out everything when you use them and the noise cancelling is brilliant, won't disappoint. For heavy usage (about 4hours a day) it will lose about 30 to 40 Percent,so it could last 2-3 days like that. The battery charges very quickly,in my experience it never took more than 2 hours max. They are also super comfortable. The latency is the only bad thing,the sound quality drops alot if you move away from the device you're paired with. Hope you find this useful.", "OK, I have lived with these headphones for a few months now and I heartily recommend them - but I do have a couple of reservations. The sound is astonishing - it is as if you are listening to analogue source material much of the time, with punch and gumption right across the frequency range. I am hearing new sonics buried low in the mix on albums I thought I knew intimately - and effortlessly pointillistic psychoacoustic flourishes on recordings that employ this kind of audio trickery.But.When I walk along while wearing the headphones, there is an occasional WHOOMP in sound as a tension in my neck muscles causes the earcup to momentarily break its acoustic seal. This also happens when I am eating food. Chew *WHOOMP* chew *WHOOMP* chew *WHOOMP*. Very disconcerting. A sudden gust of wind will surprise the noise cancellation too - and don't try and listen on a noisy tube train unless you want a constant fufufufufufufufubb of pressure changes appearing in the music.Also the touch controls on the right earcup are ridiculously sensitive. I will quite often accidentally activate Siri when I am trying to adjust the headphones on my head. It takes a while to finesse the act of turning up the volume without jumping to the start/end of a track. You will find special ways of moving the headphones around on your head to avoid accidentally pressing something. Worse still, there appears to be no option to disable these touch controls, so just be careful!So in summary: phenomenal, hyper-real sound staging, but try not to move around while wearing them.", "My fourth headset and returned within a month of use. Compared to quite many headsets, WH-1000XM3 is the BEST \ud83d\udc4dThis product is too good to complain. But when the flaws start to takeover, complaining is inevitable.Below are the issues because of which I returned the product:1. After certain level of volume, left cap starts making abnormal sounds (similar to knocking a door). This is clearly audible when travelling in a bus/car and vehicle moves on an uneven road.2. Bluetooth gets disconnected from the device (Mobile, TV, Laptop etc. \u2013 have faced it while connected with all these 3). You might need to restart the headset.3. Took hell lot of time and effort to connect the headset to Amazon fireTVstick.4. Sometimes doesn\u2019t automatically connect to the previously connected device (and immediate device from which it was disconnected earlier) unless unpaired and re-connected as if it is the first time.Hopefully, this is a defective piece. Will order the same product again.PS: Still so impressed with this product that I want to give a 5 star rating!!", "These headphones are undoubtedly some of the best on the market. The noice cancelling is incredible, the sound  is amazing and the look is absolute quality.In terms of software, they were easy to connect to my phone and the app is well worth buying.There are two reasons why I gave this 4/5. The price and and the buttons (or lack of).The price is high but there aren't any other pairs of headphones for a lower price that have the sound and noice cancelling quality that these do. Despite this I was annoyed about having to spend this amount of money.The buttons were the second reason. Though I liked the idea of (mostly) buttonless headphones, it was a bit of a struggle getting used to the touch pad. I got used to them eventually, however I'd like to think that they'd have no flaws given the amount of money I spent on them.Overall, these headphones are worth the money and completely live up to what people say about them in terms of noice cancelling ability.I recommend if you're looking for the best headphones for this price or if you're looking for the best headphones for noice cancelling.", "I bought these as a present, and only recently had a very short chance to try them personally.Short listen showed they are extremely comfortable, highest quality build, with very low sound leakage. Sound quality seemed very impressive, with good depth and good separation.Didn't have a chance to try any of the controls - and obviously no ability to check the extremely long battery life claimed.", "Amazing build quality. ANC is very impressive. Drowns traffic and even office noise quite well. Impressive.Sound quality is not great for \u00a3250. I have to be honest and say that I like my music flat (I'm a sound engineer after all) and was very disappointed with these. A lot of bass in the mix, and the bass-mids were really muddy. I guess it depends what genre of music you listen to. But if you like rock with British type guitars and gnarly mids these are not for you. I can imagine that for someone that listens to electronic styles with lots of sub bass this would be great but yeah, not for me.Returned them", "Amazing noise cancellation, sounds is decent albeit it slightly muddled with the hard hitting bass, touch controls work well and the comfort was fairly decent.Two issues resulted in 2 pair going back. First creaked, this is a common fault and very distracting. 2nd size was the mic, absolutely awful for phone calls.", "I purchased these in December on the back of the fantastic reviews. I mainly brought them for the noise cancelling as i use my phone heavily. As soon as I got them i did a firmware upgrade which totally destroyed the noise cancelling. When  I put my headphones on everything is quiet due to the noise cancelling kicking in. The problem is as soon as i make or receive a call the noise cancelling switches off and magnifies the outside noise by a factor of 5 (noticeable when outside). I thought it must be something to do with my settings so went onto the official Sony forum where i discovered shed loads of people having the same issue and it would seam Sony are not interested in responding to anyones reported issues. I have therefore sent them back to Amazon as faulty and asked for my money back. Please note this is my experience but please do your homework before purchasing them. Sony's own forum is a good place to start.", "Sound quality and noise cancellation are excellent.However, software is annoyingly buggy! Every few days I need to repair the Bluetooth. Sometimes Bluetooth stops working for no apparent reason. This makes it all very annoying. It's difficult for me to recommend this product.Please fix the software!", "Not when I bought these they were easily the best noise-cancelling headphones on the market (say all the online reviewers worth listening to) they may be superseded by new versions from other manufacturers but there still a great pair of headphones.  The noise cancelling will generate blaster if they rub on clothes or and wind is Blaenau for the mics, and they're going to be no good for the gym or very hot weather because they keep it is pretty toasty.  touch controls on the earpiece can sometimes be a bit temperamental but I haven't experienced the reported problems with it at 0 degrees.", "I had bose quietcomfort 25, and sound quality on this is noticeable better over whole range. Bose have balance moved to base,  mid frequency is suffering.From another hand I prefer bose\u2019s button controls. Sony\u2019s touch pad is very annoying, and triggers itself all the time.Voice control is also pointless for me, and you cannot turn it off completely. It randomly triggers and calls my friends. I hate it.Noise cancelling is not as good as Bose, however it doesn\u2019t make a vacuum effect. It\u2019s good enough for me.Overall headphones are really good, I would probably buy a previous model without voice control.", "The noise cancellation on these phones is top of the range. They can even remove the noise of next door's yappy Jack Russell.Unfortunately the base is horribly over done. I'm absolutely astonished that a well known hifi mag gave these 5 stars. The bass can be partially adjusted using the app's built in graphic equalizer. But even on minimum the bass is over the top. But worst of all, this can only be adjusted on bluetooth, and only on the SBC codec. If you use the phones with aptX or wired, in other words when you want the highest music quality, then you're stuck with the bloated bass.I asked Sony if there was some way to get round this. They confirmed that you could only adjust the bass on SBC.", "Amazing bought these to replace my beats studio 3 wireless headphones. I had enough of the connectivity issues I was having with the beats studio 3 wireless, that I decided to look at another Paris headphones which was the Sony mx1000 m3. These headphones have a good sound and are very comfortable even after wearing them for long periods of time. I use these headphones for gaming, DJing and just for generally day to day usage. Added to this the headphones also has an app which allows you to change the setting of the headphones for example if you want more or less base you can adjust it in the app. My favourite setting is the concert mode making it feel like you are listening to your favourite song at a concert live.Overall the Sony mx1000 m3 are great headphones they offer comfort, food sound, lots of features through the app and lastly great build quality. I would 100 percent buys these headphones over the beats studio 3 wireless. (This is coming from a person who has bought beats their whole life)", "I bought these headphones with high hopes as it was a successor to the B&amp;W PX.  It was more comfortable and was great in most parts except it failed miserably in looks and the warming of the ears.  When placed on the head, it looked like two large doughnuts at the side of my head.I might have a warm head in general but the cups on these get hot within 5 minutes of use.  Cannot use headphones if they're making your ears sweat.All in all great functions and noise cancellation was great.  Unfortunately because of the above reasons I sent the headphones back.  Now have Bose QC III and although not up to scratch in terms of tech, it feels lovely to use and have adored them since purchasing them.Good luck and I hope this review helps someone.", "<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\" id=\"video-block-R15GB76SPVDQXA\"></div><input class=\"video-url\" name=\"\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/C1x-Rcd1SZS.mp4\"/><input class=\"video-slate-img-url\" name=\"\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1cmBAz1oSS.png\"/>\u00a0This Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones are top notch on noise cancelling features and bass focus sound. To be honest I wasn't expecting a good sound quality on these headphones but if you are a person who really enjoy the heavy bass on songs this product won't dissapoint you.Regarding the noise cancelling I have test these headphones on different enviroments.For the office this is perfect as there is practically no sound leakiing.For commuting I have used this a lot on the train and when you enable the noise cancelling feature you will hear only your music, podcast or whatever you are listen to. The noise cancelling adapts to your enviroment but you need to make sure to download the app and update the headphones. Also make sure to play with the setting to get the best from them.This Sony are really confortable and ligth weight, they can be a bit warm on hot days but in general I can wear this for hours and not get tired.Finally the sound, and in this I can say this headphones are really good if you enjoy bass. In general the quality is great but you cannot espect the best quality sound when the noise cancelling is on as there are certain frequencies this headphones have to play in order to cancel the noise.As a tech reviewer I'm always comparing products and looking for the best and definately this Sony WH-1000XM3 are on my top list.", "What can I say this is the best pair of noise cancelling headphones I have ever had. It has received 5 stars in every area. If you like your music with a good base then these are the headphones for you. A bit pricey but I don't mine shelling out for quality kit.  The only down side is that the charging cable is very short. It uses USB C so I ordered some adaptors from Amazon so I could use my mobile phone charging cable.", "Love these headphones. The noise cancelling is the best I have experienced and the sound quality is great.The headphones are very comfortable for extended use although your ears get warm this has never proved a problem.Bluetooth connection is quick and stable and range is very impressive.Battery life is amazing - even with heavy use these won\u2019t need to be recharged very often.Lovely storage case allows the headphones to be folded flat for easy transportation.Looking forward to using these soon on a longhaul flight.Got these for a good discount in the Black Friday sale - the expected new model will have to be very good to match/beat these!", "These are okay headphones. But for the price I would expect much better. In my opinion the equaliser is absolutely essential to make these listenable. They are all bass otherwise. A bit like beats I think. I have much cheaper wired headphones that sound a lot better.The noise cancelling is quite good but gives me the sensation of pressure in my ears. And again I'm not completely blown away compared to other noise cancelling I've tried, but it is probably a bit better.I do really like the case they come on and they are comfortable. I think I'll be keeping them, but had hoped for better.", "Picure the scene - an open plan office of approx 50 people.\"Barry, ey Barry did ya go to the footie this weekend?\" Bellows Steve three banks of desks away.\"Hiya Steve, yeah it was...\"'heaphones on'......Silence.I was going nuts with the level of incidental and unnecessary noise at work. Now I hardly hear it. If I put some music on, then I don't hear anything else - even something quiet like Aarvo Part is sufficient to remove Barry, Steve and the football from my world.", "I bought these after reading many reviews online and it seems the people writing the reviews have never used good quality wired headphones, to me the sound quality is disappointing.  There is very little clarity, plenty of bass if that's what you want but they don't come close to the quality of proper headphones.  The noise cancelling is very effective and if you want them for travel etc then they are very impressive.  Just don't expect high quality audio.", "I would give this a 4.5 stars instead of a 5. While everyone has already covered all the incredible features of these headphones (noise cancelling, sound quality, comfort, battery and all that), there were a few minor things that aren't dealbreakers but would be useful to know when you buy them.1. Sound quality - sound is incredible but if you're coming from a standard pair of in-the-box headphones, you may find these a bit bass-y and low volume. I have found that creating a customer Equaliser setting to be the most helpful in opening up the mid-ranges a little bit more while preserving the good bass tones.2. Noise cancelling - best way to do this is through the app as I find the buttons to be very frustrating as it takes atleast 3-5 seconds to cycle through each NC mode3. I would recommend folding the headphones the way they're meant to for the box but just switching up which ear cup is folded as I wouldn't want wear and tear on just the left one.4. If you have long hair and want to tap the touch controls on the right ear cup - you will have to brush your hair aside as it won't register a touch through your hair.5. Connection is a bit slower and less intuitive that I'm used to (I have apple products and a pair of AirPods so everything is slow in comparison to that) I have learned that switching devices means you will have to disconnect from one and reconnect with another. Minor issue but still had to learn the hard way.Overall - these will last me YEARS and are already worth the money. I commute on the Tube everyday and the sounds are deafening. These were incredible and still let me hear the announcements!", "I have used Bose QC35 for 2 years and very pleased with them.I did a side by side comparison;- noise cancellation (my no 1 feature); there's not a lot in it but for me Sony's are definitely better, and particularly give a more mellow life.- sound on audio; for me Sony's are materially better on this.- comfort; both fine. Clearly feel a bit sticky if e.g. walking fast up a hill. But that's ok.", "The sound on these is great.  But buy them and you are likely to be very annoyed every time you switch them on.  Why?  Because  they connect with the last used Bluetooth device and you cannot toggle between devices on the headphones or even with the app.  The headphones don't tell you what device they are connect to either.  The only way to change devices is to switch off the Bluetooth on the connected app and then connect with the other device.  Sony have known about this problem in previous iterations but have done nothing about it.  They may come close to the Bose QC35s in terms of sound and cancelling, but there is no comparison about ease of use for those that have multiple bluetooth devices - Bose wins.", "These are by far the best headphones i have ever owned and i love the fact i can use noise cancelling mode on trains and hear nothing but my music, it really makes a difference from normal headphones and love the ability to press a button and bear the world around me so I don't even have to remove them when someone talks to me. I charged it for 5 mins and it would last me a couple hours which is great as sometimes need to rush out and don't have time to charge them but just 5 mins and i have nearly half a days worth of music", "These headphones are light, comfy and provide amazing sound quality and noise cancellation. The only drawbacks that I've noticed are:1- Microphone in phone calls, terrible quality. It amplifies the background noise making it really annoying to the person at the other end. I actually upgraded from the Sennheiser Momentum 2 to these thinking i'd get a better piece for phone calls. Even though, I'm still happy with this purchase. The noise cancellation and comfortableness these headphones offer really made me wanting to keep them.2- You cannot to multiple bluetooth devices at the same time. To switch between devices you'll have to disconnect one before you can connect the other.", "I bought this headphones mainly to mute all the noises in my house but found it didn't do a big difference - I could still hear everything, just slightly less - the same as if I'd have put some ear plugs (that cost for 10p)...The sound quality is about the same as the tiny Apple Airpods I have and I find them much more comfortable to wear than these big headphones.The gestures didn't quite work - it was just annoying that you expect them to do one thing but they do something different.Sorry have to return", "Went to John Lewis to try these against the Bose QC35II. Noise cancelling on both is pretty comparable and the Bose pair are slightly more comfortable on my ears. However, as soon as I connected my phone and cranked the volume up, I was blown away. The richness of the sound is incredible and you seem to get a lot more bass coming through with the Sony's.After listening to both it was an easy decision for me and no regrets so far.", "Entirely happy with my purchase, these are amazing cans. I tried the B&amp;W PX first, but never felt the sound quality or noise cancelling were very good and chose to replace them with these. Versus a previous generation Sennheiser Momentum and AKG K-550, the Sony are clearly superior. As a point of preference, I typically run these with the 'Bright' sound profile - it helps balance some of the default bass emphasis that can make them sound a bit muddy.", "These are excellent for noise cancellation on any transport, trains, planes, cars, buses etc.  They can improve a journey no end.  But I would never use them for listening at home.  For instance, the Grado Labs SR80 at \u00a384 are a far more pleasurable listen (admittedly neither bluetooth nor noise cancelling).  This is of course because I'm judging an open back headset, with it's infinite airiness and the clarity of it's spectrum wide response, against the more muted and constipated sounds eminating from closed back headphones.  Buy these for travel, but not for home use - unless of course the cacophony from children/teenagers/neighbours/over head aircraft/ nearbye motorways etc is too much to bear.", "I'm sure many reviews have covered the positive points of these headphones so I will just cover the reasons why I did not like them and why I ended up returning them:- Aptx HD can only be used with most of the sound enhancements turned off, so to customize the sound you have to lower the sound quality down to SBC which has a lot more latency making movies and games have a noticeable delay and reduced sound quality.- Sound is heavily modified from reference. This was my main reason for returning it, these headphone like many others have had the sound boosted and changed in certain frequencies.--- The bass is too powerful and not as clear as a pair of good speakers, regardless of EQ settings--- Because they have \"tweaked\" the sound, some music sounds better, but some sounds alot worse- Gave me ear ache...  after using these for about 30 mins and medium to high volume my ears hurt. The boosted bass on these headphones is too powerful and I expect would damage my hearing over time.- Latency... even with Aptx enabled the latency was still noticable when watching movies or games, unfortunately I was not able to use Aptx LL with my phone (Galaxy S9) so a bit disappointingAll in all I just didnt like the way the headphones sounded, while these speakers can sound good its bass heavy and quieter in the mid and highs which means you have to turn the volume up louder making the bass even more over powerful.", "I recently upgraded to the XM3s from an XM2 I had before and am over the moon about the decision. The design has been far improved and sits far more comfortably on the head, greatest difference probably being the weight (lighter) and the cushioning at the top. The previous model was already a very comfy pair of headphones but Sony have upped the game with these ones. Sound is still as great as it was before, but I haven't compared to the XM2s side by side as yet.The inclusion of a USB-C charging point was a great \"nice to have\". This way I can use my phone/laptop charger in case I'm low on battery on the go (though the battery lasts ages, even though I'm pretty much wearing these all day). Overall would highly recommend!", "If like me you suffer from the disease of buying headphones looking for the Holy Grail in sound quality you may well have found it here.  Amazing battery life, easy to set up and extremely comfortable (and I am a glasses wearer).  Looks wise - very understated compared to the looks of Sennheiser and B and W.  But I can honestly say these beat Bose,  B and W hands down.  I've been listening to mainly rock and indie and the sound is simply lush.  On remastered tracks, you will simply hear detail that wasn't audible before - on older recordings the cans will expose shortcomings but therein lies their accuracy.  I've found some headphones to have harsh vocals not these just a warmth (but not bright) vocal.Expensive but worth it.", "I may not be a technical expert but I love these headphones for listening to music, especially the very effective noise cancelling function, based on the level of ambient noise. Can be used either wired or wireless. You can also control volume level by stroking a finger over the right side cover. You can also hold a conversation with a person nearby by covering the right side cover with your palm, whilst still wearing the phones. There are a couple of functions (pausing play, and skipping tracks) that I haven't been able to get to work but I'm not too concerned. Comfortable to wear for long periods.", "Only ever spent \u00a330 max on headphones before this, worth the price? all relative. Battery, features, noise cancel features are all impeccable, sound quality - hard to know, can the music be even better, mmm unsure. I would have chosen black in hindsight, the grey is cool and a little less generic, however the headphones look 'dirtier' when grey. exceptional and one of the best material items i own", "I'm no cork sniffing audiophile but I always want to listen to my music at the highest possible quality without spending 1000's. Due to a no doubt short lived effort to get fitter I decided I wanted some wireless earphones. Tried the Melomania but despite the fanastic reviews they seemed incredibly tinny to me, despite trying all the bud tips. Then I tried the Sony WF1000 mx3 earbuds: fanastic sound but I just couldn't find the right fit for my ears and they kept falling out. So, despite not really wanti g to go over the 200 mark I plumped for these. Believe the hype - these are a revelation. Unbelievable bass but still so clear in the mids and highs, supremely comfortable, huge battery life, great app for fiddling with the eq etc. Worth every penny and would recommend in a heartbeat.", "I was a bit apprehensive when I ordered these headphones, as  have a small head, and when I purchased my last set, the majority had large head pieces which did not fit me.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the box to find a lovely neatly packed pair of headphones that fitted perfectly.  I am not very tech minded, so they are a bit over the head in technology for me, but I managed to pair them with my iPad, and they work great.  The battery lasts a long time, and they are quick to charge.  I am a happy bunny.", "The noise cancelling on the wh-1000 xm3 is superb. It's completely transformed train journeys and takes out nearly train noise. Not only is the noise cancelling great but the audio quality is second to none, really deep bass and the high frequencies don't become tinny like previous headphones. For the most part they are comfortable in long stretches but I have to find just the right position on my head otherwise my ears do begin to hurt. One of the most useful features is the ability to 'cup' your hand over the right headphone and it will lower the audio and bring up the ambient noise in order to hear train announcements etc.The one negative would be the Bluetooth connection is affected quite badly in busy stations (especially London bridge) where even when I've selected all options for stable connection over quality, I find I have to keep my phone fairly close to the headphones. Not a problem in any other location though.", "I really have no idea how someone can give 5 stars to these but, hey, it's not my call.Had them for 2 days. And now they are on their way back. Really cheap feel. Sound is just average with a bit boosted low. Volume control and all other controls are sub par. Ok, i get that, someone love it. Not me. But it's not all bad. Those are really comfy, lightweight with good connection stability. All in all, there is no justification for this price. If they are between 150-180 ...fine...but for 300\u20ac..no way.", "I tried some \u00a390 Taotronics BH055 noise cancelling headphones as a more \"budget\" option, which were decent for the money. But these Sony XM3s are a in a different league.The noise cancellation is absolutely first class. It's quite staggering just how much background noise they block out. Add to that how comfortable they are, amazing battery life and while I'm sure much more expensive audiophile headphones will sound better, they still sound very good. And the difference in sound quality between these and the Taotronics was very obvious.The only thing missing is being able to pair to multiple devices at the same time, but that's only a very minor negative.I know Sony should be due to release an updated version probably this year, but most talk points to somewhere around September. So if you're on the fence about these and considering waiting, don't. Just buy them and you'll be glad you did.", "Wow.I was looking for a set of headphones that provided amazing sound quality and good noise cancellation. These headphones tick those boxes.Very easy to use and set up, the audio quality is the best I've heard from a set of headphones. The bass isnt overpowering, everything is very well balanced. But, if you wanted you can adjust it on the EQ in the app. The noise cancelling is quite something too. You cant hear much through these headphones, even if they're not switched on.Physically, they're quite lightweight  and dont clamp my head so are comfortable for hours on end.These arent cheap, but will provide many hours of joy. I very much reccomend.", "Oh, Sony, you have done what I thought was impossible - you have comprehensively trounced Bose in every way. Better sound, solid Bluetooth connection, almost spookily effective noise-cancelling, easy to use and extremely light and comfortable. As I have a noise phobia, I have spent quite a bit on head and earphones over the years, mostly Bose. These are the very best headphones I have ever owned. Worth every penny.", "My first pair of these seemed great until they developed a blowing sound in the left ear after two weeks which ruined the experience, seemed to be a fault with the noise cancellation technology. As I researched this issue I noticed that others have also experienced this also. The headphones are fantastic in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation, I can't fault them for that so I have returned and got a new pair in the hope I won't get this issue again. Strangely the noise cancellation and sound quality on the new pair seems far superior to my first pair straight out the box, I strongly suggest if the headphones don't seem quite right to return and get a new pair, there's an obvious difference between the two pairs I've owned. The app for iphone is an incredible addition to fine tune the sound to your liking. I'm hoping my issue was just down to bad luck, these headphones are worth the money in my opinion. I wore these on a 13 hour flight and the cancellation blocked out the engine sounds and allowed me to have the best sleep I've ever had on a plane. 4/5", "Sent my Bose QC35II's back due to poor bluetooth connection and bought these bad boys instead. Should have went straight for these from the get go! Better sound quality, bluetooth actually works and stays connected, comfortable and light. Noise cancellation is unbelievable can't hear anything from the outside and others cant hear the headphones at all. The features in the app are great with a built in equalizer and different sound modes etc. Battery life is also brilliant. Honestly a perfect pair of headphones take my hat off to Sony for these!!", "Headphones itself are doing great job. As I used them around 1 month or more.Complete noise canceling in the airplane which helps to have extra time for sleep/rest instead listening for running engine and people around.Overall great product but the way they design microphone is a shame.As mic. Picks up sound from outside, so you and the person you are talking to, hear everything as in the recors studio and barely can talk.As a headphones 5 star, but as headset 3 stars is top.", "Purchased these as they had rave reviews and was in the market for some good quality headphones that supported Aptx HD/LDAC.ProsProduct feels quality built and really premiumSound is really decent and was super clearSimple and easy to connect to the phoneNow these updated there firmware and all of a sudden the ANC started to pick up voices more clearly, which is a real shame as they are quality headphones.I have of course seen multiple posts on the sony forums and seen videos of people doing noise tests and such but i can quite clearly hear voices much more clearly with the new firmware.So sadly i have returned them for a full refund, it might be the case that they sort out a firmware at a later date.", "I've been after some noise cancellation headphones for quite a while and I've always been put off by how ewxpensive they are. Just before Christmas I took the leap and bought these, mostly because I could pay for them in 5 monthly no interest payments. I didn't know what to expect but the second I put them on in the office and could no longer hear people chatting away and even the sound of the aircon was gone I thought to myself wow these are worth every penny.I'm still shocked at how loud the aircon is and it's only once I take the headphones off after using them for even just a few minutes that it sounds like there's a really strong wind outside blowing a gale.", "The sound quality, comfort, noise cancelling and gesture controls are all good, nothing to complain about in regards to those. However, ever since I downloaded the app (which Sony tells you to do) I\u2019ve had nothing but connectivity issues. The headphones don\u2019t connect half of the time, when they do they just constantly disconnect and then reconnect every few seconds. Switching between devices that the headphones are connected to isn\u2019t as seamless as other Bluetooth headphones either, with these it won\u2019t let you switch devices until you go to the first device and disconnect the headphones and only then can you connect them to the second device. All this is pretty poor considering how expensive these headphones are.", "The right earpiece of headphones started making weird quiet noises after 4 months. The distorted noise is as if you can hear the blood in your veins flowing. But it is the headpiece because when I put the right earpiece on my left ear, I can hear the noise in my left ear.I should also say that I only use these headphones at work, I don't travel with them. They are on my desk in the office all day. So it's impossible that they got damaged.", "The audio cable is so poorly made it bent easily in an aircraft seat probably when I was standing up. This component is not designed an manufacture to be sufficiently robust to survive the environment it will be used in. This problem is not confined to Sony and I have heard of Bose and other manufacturers headphones having exactly the same problem. Why build headphone with superb sound quality and noise cancellation, then cut costs by including flimsy parts tarnishing Sony's reputation.", "- Excellent noise cancellation and very clever adaptive noise cancelling feature to let in graduated levels of ambient noise to suit the situation.- Really comfortable, even when worn with glasses. I usually find over early headphones uncomfortable as they press the ear on to the earpiece of the glasses. Not these.- Sound quality is great. I use these for mainly for video editing, listening to music and podcasts. Decent base for music and good clarity with voices.- Battery life pretty good. For my casual/moderate use I get around 3 weeks per charge. They also charge up fairly quickly.- Pairing. My only frustration with these headphones. I often switch between devices like phone, tablet, computer depending what I\u2019m doing. Switching between devices is frustrating as I seem to have to put the headphones in to pairing mode every time I switch from the last paired device. My devices (iPhone, iPad, MacBook) all remember the headphones in the Bluetooth menu but just selecting a different device from the Bluetooth menu doesn\u2019t work, they will switch devices but I won\u2019t get any sound until I use pairing mode. I know the Bose equivalents lets you have 2 devices paired to easily switch between and all of my Apple earphones (AirPods, Beats) switch devices super easy with no fuss. This is annoying as it could probably be fixed with a software update. All in all it is still just a small niggle. If these headphones broke today, I would buy them again straight away.", "Tried these side by side with the Bose QC35, which is always the pair it seems to come down to in head to head reviews.Noise cancelling was great on both, but the Sonys had the sound quality by a tiny margin to my ear. Comfortable enough for me to wear for most of the working day. My only concern long term is that the ear pad cushions are not designed to be replaceable, a terrible oversight for such a flagship product. Guess I'll worry about that when the time comes though, until then, love them.", "I thought it was time to upgrade my pairs of XM2 as I was hesitant to start as I was unsure what had changed. However with the all the praise this headphones have been getting (combined with sweet discounts), I finally got a pair.First of all, the XM2 had amazing ANC which I thought would be impossible to improve on but this is even better at blocking out talking and practically all ambient noise. The only thing it does not block is higher pitch noise or sudden loud noises but they are drastically muffled.The biggest changes are the fit and the upgrade to USB C. I thought the XM2 was pretty comfy but these are more roomy and so I don't feel the need to readjust as often. I own a S8 which charges with USB c so this means I can carry one cable to charge my phone and headphones which is a god send.Wrapping up with sound quality. I am not an audiophile but I can say that in my opinion this has great sound quality with resonating bass and a good sound stage. There are many other headphones out there that sound better.... but you have to fork out more cash or remove features.All in all, I think this is the best overall ANC headphones when taking all factors into consideration. I probably would not have bought it at it's MSRP but it is basically always at 240-280 so it is a real good deal.", "Just about perfect!Gestures take a little bit of getting used to but they really are a great idea. I\u2019ve never had Noise Cancellation before; why did I wait so long. I\u2019ve had really good headphones in the past but these are the best. Bear in mind they come with a really good case so don\u2019t, like I did, get caught out with what other people bought or looked at. Anyone want to buy a case?!!!", "I've had these for about two weeks now and I'm starting to notice the issues that these have. The sound quality is great, nothing to say, especially when the noise cancelling function works properly. But when I'm walking or commuting, the noise cancelling function stutters constantly, even if I've completely turned off the ambient. The ambient keeps overriding the NC, which is really annoying. So the price is absolutely not justifiable unfortunately. I was expecting them at least to work properly.", "I bought this for my son who has hearing problems , hypersensitivity. When it arrives he noticed that there was a cliking notice in the right ear cup . When looking into this many people online/Reddit this problem seems to be widspread and  It is highly annoying", "Amazing!  Was pondering some of these for a couple of years as didn\u2019t want to spend this much as a bit extravagant, however to9 the plunge and was not disappointed, great sound and noise reduction is really good.", "These headphones are epic. I've used Bowers and Wilkins in recent years as well as Sennheiser, but these wipe the floor with both brands. More bass, mid, trebble. More clarity and tone, too.They're considerably cheaper. These were almost \u00a3100 cheape the the BW PX7sMy verdict? Amazing, couldn't be happier. Other brands might 'feel' more study, and even though these are largely plastic (the BWs for instance have carbon on the head band), the Sonys are definitely sturdy enough and have a great fit.Whatever genre of music, the app allows you to adjust to suit the music you listen too.Buy buy buy! 10/10.", "The reason for 4 stars is the unit is suppled with a USB C charging lead about 200mm long miles to short to be of any use. Had to purchase a longer lead. Having said that they are a very good pair of head phones The NC is very good and the downloadable app is quite good. Never understand why with a quality product like this they supply a poor user manual. would I buy them again?  YES", "There are plenty of plus sides to these cans and I go everywhere with them. However I will say that there is only one slight downside.If you're in a windy environment with them on, you will hear the hissing of the wind as it enters the side inputs. That's the only downside!The sound quality is brilliant, the features it comes with as well as how well you can interact with it is phenomenal and overall I'm pleased with the purchase.", "I thought the noise cancelling was a gimmick but I was totally wrong and it is amazing! I love these headphones as they look smart and have great sound quality. But the main reason I love them is because it puts me in my own wonder world during my commute, eliminating all those pesky commuters that feel the need to tell people their life stories on the commute to work.", "I've been a loyal Sennheiser customer for years and got alured by the great noise cancelling being advertised by Sony. Big mistake! While they are indeed great ANC headsets they sound muddy with exaggerated bass. I could have got over that but the deal breaker is definitely using them for conference calls. Awful! Echoing and muffled speech coming from the other end. I'll return these and get back to my loved Sennheiser SPX 550 which are much better than this garbage. Never again Sony.", "I wish I could give 6 stars. I've researched far and wide to find the best over ear wireless cans. I had a set of AKG50 bt's and I loved them until my good woman lost them. I purchased these recently and so far they have blown me away. The sound is awesome, slightly bassy but I love it. They are comfortable and the sound isolation is phenomenal.  On the underground you can't hear any noise at all. I can't recommend these highly enough.  I purchased a slightly cheaper set of Sony phones as well, and while they are good, they can't touch these for quality. These are quite pricey, but with the 5 monthly payments interest free, I couldn't not buy them", "Just won\u2019t stay connected to my Apple Mac.  Useless for the purpose I bought them for.  I spend my whole journey wa9ting for them to connect. Annoying.  Very annoying.", "I've gone through many headphones, but I've never really had the chance to get proper noise canceling ones. I've heard a ton about these headphones and decided to make them my first official noise-canceling headphones.And man, these headphones are amazing!The noise canceling is mind-blowing, I ride the subway every day and I hear from little to nothing. It's pure bliss. You can also adjust how much ambient sound comes through which is a nice touch along with the option to cover the right earcup with your palm and be able to hear everything around you which is extremely useful in many situations!Along with that, the sound quality is astonishing. The bass is really clear and punchy but doesn't overpower any other sounds. Everything sounds clear, the vocals sound really clean, there's a very good balance between all the lows, mids and highs.  They're basically the best sound you can get on a pair of headphones.The functionality of skipping tracks, raising the volume and pausing with the headphones felt seamless, there are times where I barely take out my phone to skip a track.Also, the battery life is insane, I go 3 days without having to charge these, these are great for long trips or flights.The headphones also feel really comfortable, my only problem is sometimes my ears can get a little sweaty at times, it's not a huge issue but it can be really annoying as I'll have to take off my headphones for a couple seconds just to cool off my ears. Thankfully, it's only happened about 3 or 4 times in my week so far of using it, so it isn't an extremely huge problem.Overall, these headphones are absolutely amazing and I'd recommend them to anybody who wants amazing noise canceling and sound in their headphones.Noise-canceling - 10/10Sound Quality - 10/10Convenience + Design - 10/10Comfortability - 9/10Overall - 9.75/10", "I sold my old beats studios for these, and I'm so glad I did, superb sound quality with great sound cancelling features, even the headphone app works well, my only gripe is the range for wireless, my old beats worked up the garden when my phone was in the lounge, the sony break up when I get by the back door or go upstairs, but this is only a very minor gripe, as being fussy. If you have your device on you you'll never experience the issues anyway", "For a pair of \u00a3300+ Sony headphones, I expect a decent bit of kit for my money.  This product delivers but it has some drawbacks.  The phones are quite bulky-looking.  For a 49yo who was brought up on earbuds and the original foam-cupped walkman headphones, these stick out quite a bit on the street.  Secondly, they're not ideal for use in warm climates, as the weight and materials can cause a certain amount of sweating.  I may be wrong, but I can't see salt being good for longevity.  Lastly, I got an 8-week old springador puppy yesterday and whilst the phones can do a great job of blocking out general noises like powerful fan-driven machinery or bus and train journeys, I would suggest that Sony get some puppies into their testing centre for future iterations of this product.", "Using it with the app, when it is changing the noise cancelling modes to adapt to the surroundings, it makes a notification sound and interrupts the music, which is annoying. I have uninstalled the app. Other than that, top-notch quality, elegant design, the best headphones I ever had.Later edit:1. I am not always happy with the touch controls, sometimes they are a little bit erratic.2. Previously, I had a pare of Sony h.ear on MDR-100ABN noise-cancelling headphones.  Compared to them, but also as it's advertised, I've expected a better lifetime battery for Sony Wh-1000xM3. But it doesn't feel this way, I don't know why...", "The headphones have been regularly recharged and software updated and they have performed really well.I've been careful to keep these in their case and they look as good as new.  The battery life is as good as promised, as is the noise cancellation.  As a result, the sound is a little duller than I'd like but still excellent.I use these on the underground and it significantly reduces the amount of audible noise created from some of the very loud parts of the line.I would recommend these to anyone looking to seriously invest in a pair of good quality headphones.Pro's:StylishComfortableVery long battery lifeGood noise cancellationCon's:Ears get hot after wearing for an extended time.Big on head (over ear headphones)Sound not as bright sounding as I'd like.", "I bought my wife the XM2's for Christmas and was very impressed with the sound quality and battery life, so I decided to get some but all the offers for the XM2s had gone so bought the XM3s. Not  a lot of difference in sound, charging port is USB C.Noise cancellation is strange at first as you seem to be in your own little world!If you receive a phone call when wearing them, kill the noise cancelling as it works alot better.They are comfortable even with glasses on and they fold away nicely.", "Bought for \u00a3229.00. Received 1st December 2019.I was hesitant for a while due to the price. If you're considering Apple headphones or some other expensive alternative I'd definitely recommend these instead as they seem to be the best all-round noise cancelling headphones on the market. I travel a lot and it's a much more pleasant experience having these in my arsenal. To my surprise, though, I use them even more at home.I use them every day which is why I'm very happy with the value.", "So basically i bought the WH-1000XM3 from Amazon bland new sold by Sony on January the 25th. I immediately noticed bass distortion on some songs but I wasn`t sure that the problem is caused by my phone, bluetooth connection or software. I knew that the headphones amplify the bass but on some bass heavy songs it was distorting a lot. One more thing, this was happening only when i turn on noice cancelling and equalizer to OFF.  I tried every possible sollution without success. I`ve also tried to find somebody who has the same issue but nothing. I had one more option - to test them in any shop i could find them. A week ago i found them at the airport and I tested the same songs. There was no issue whatsoever. Now I`m sure that I`ve reseaved defective unit and I want to return it and get refund. I paid exactly 292.34 pounds for brand new. They are in perfect condition, always kept in the case like new!", "I bought a pair of Bose QC35iis that arrived damaged, so I returned them and ordered these instead. I hoped for no problems with build quality and was looking forward to the improved features that these headphones afforded over the QC35iis such as longer battery life, touch controls, USB-C charging, and better noise-cancellation. The touch controls were clunky and barely worked for me (I appreciate that it takes time to build muscle memory), and I am unable to comment on any charging-related features as I didn't own these for long enough. They were so uncomfortable. The headphones clamp your head and your ears touch the inner lining of the ear cups. Your head becomes hot and your ears sweat after about 10 minutes of wearing. I tried to push through it and ignore the irritation because the noise cancelling is fantastic, but I couldn't. If you want noise-cancelling headphones that you can wear for longer than 20 minutes without having to take off, look elsewhere. A real shame as it is a good product with regards to technical specifications.I bought noise-cancelling headphones to reduce distractions when working. The Bose QC35iis are, in my opinion, more fit for purpose than these.Disclaimer: I am only mentioning the Bose QC35iis specifically as both of these headphones are at the same price-point and are widely debated online - just offering my opinion!", "Everything is good with these headphones except one major showstopper.If, like me, you have multiple devices (a PC and a phone perhaps..) and you switch between devices regularly, then this is not the headset for you.As an example:- Let's say that while working you would like to receive call / audio from both your PC and phone (something that the Bose headsets do really well), then you'll be disappointed with the XM3 because it won't work automatically, instead you have to disconnect and reconnect to the new device each time.So, for example:-You're working on your PC, listening to audio and having calls with colleagues on Slack/Skype throughout your day. Then someone calls your phone that's sat on your desk.  You would expect the headphones to switch to phone audio when you answer the call automatically.With the XM3, this isn't possible.  You can't even connect more than one device to the headset at the same time.*This means that when you get a call, you have to manually:-1) Disconnect your headphones from your PC2) Connect your headphones to your phoneThis means playing around with settings/buttons on your devices, something that could feasibly take a good 10 seconds to sort, by which time the caller may well have ended the call.For someone like me, who wants to keep the headphones on and seamlessly switch between devices as and when I need to (without worrying about connecting and disconnecting all the time), this is a real problem.It's a real shame because apart from this problem, the headphones are great.  USB-c charging, long battery life, great sound, comfortable.  In this domain of multi-connectivity, though, the Bose alternatives of the QC35 or the newer 700 model are much better because they allow multiple connections at the same time.*There is a small caveat that should be mentioned in the interest of fairness...You CAN connect the Sony XM3 headphones to two devices if you designate one device for calls and the other for media.  The moment you want to have calls from two different devices, or media from two different devices, then it won't work.", "I've had a few pairs of Bose noise cancelling earphones and given some of the reviews on here and elsewhere I thought I'd give these a go.I'm going to start with by far the worst part about these earphones and then get into the rest later; The noise cancelling turns itself off when making phone calls and actually plays noise back into the headphone! I assume this is a cack handed attempt to make sure you're able to hear the volume of your own voice, it does however completely fail in its purpose. It is almost impossible to hear any phone conversations, particularly if you're in the middle of the city. I searched online and this seems to be a common issue with these headphones. It is infuriating.They do what they're supposed to on the whole which is cancel noise. The controls take getting used to but are generally ok, until that is you want to switch between devices. The Bose equivalent are so much better when it comes to connecting multiple devices and switching between them.If you don't switch between devices and make few phone calls these are an ok pair of headphones. However, as is typical with Sony, the complete over engineering of the firmware on which they run make them completely unusable.Back to Bose.", "A fantastic pair of headphones. The noise cancelling is simply astonishing. I've owned these cans for a couple of months using them daily and literally every time I put them on, as the noise cancelling kicks in 2-3 seconds after turning them on, it puts a big smile on my face.The sound quality is very good although it is worth noting that  the overall tone is somewhat \"popularist\" insomuch as the bass is a little over done. My previous headphones, a pair of \u00a3100 Shure in-ears certainly sound better from a purely HiFi point of view when listening to certain tracks although generally speaking, the Sony headphones easily match the Shures on sound quality. Having said that, these Sony headphones come with an app that allows you to set the EQ as per your personal tastes.Overall, I'd say that these headphones are, musically excellent with the vast majority of music (8/10), very sturdy and fairly conformable (8/10) and seriously unbelievably good in the noise cancelling department (10/10).", "Noise cancelling is outstanding - uncanny!Battery life is very impressive indeed.Sound quality out if the box was a little disappointing, and it was necessary to use the app's equaliser function to liberate the excellent sound quality if these cans.Clear crisp trebles, deep controlled bass and a good sound stage are all there to be enjoyed.Really pleased I bought these, excellent product.", "Great headphones, noise cancellation gets rid of white noise and wind and drops outside noise considerably. You will hear people if your not listening to anything but the moment u turn something on, your environment doest exist.Great on planes too. Dont think i got jet lag thanks to their atmospheric controlCall quality is argueably trash for the one your talking to but i dont use it for calls. Just... everything else. If u want something for calls too get the new sony headphones.Simple", "I\u2019ve always a Bose person, I owned a Bose speaker and two Bose earphones. Before I bought this Sony headphone i was no hesitation to buy the Bose QC35 series2, but I returned it after I received it, because it doesn\u2019t as what I expected. Then I did tons of research online for the review comparisons toward these two series headphones. Today, I received it, I\u2019m now a Sony person with no hesitations. : )", "Pricey, but worth it. The sound quality is top notch, they are super comfortable and the noise cancellation is incredible, especially on planes (with these on, babies can scream all they want - bit of a game changer!).", "After purchasing these headphones I was very excited about using them - every review I read said they were the best on the market. However, when I received them I have to say the sound wasn't as good as I was expecting over Bluetooth. In addition, I couldn't adjust to the active noise cancellation which I understand does happen to lots of people. The technology of cancelling out the exterior noise through playing the inverse waves back at the user can stimulate the ear drum in an adverse way. I've now returned the headphones which is a real shame as I was really looking forward to using them. I'd recommend to other users to try these out in a store before purchasing.", "Right out of the box the headphones where amazing! About 2 hours later once they updated to the latest version of the firmware, the sound canceling has almost completely stopped working, I looked into this and there's hundreds of complaints on the same issue with Sony offering no real solutions to anyone, on top of that I bought them right before traveling and won't be able to return them before the return deadline, I advice you to stay away from these if Sound Cancelling was your need until Sony fixes this issue, but if they do, go ahead, sound quality is great, they are comfortable, and sound cancelling if working was AMAZING.", "With ldac it has the best sound quality for noise cancelling earphones. However I found it a bit not comfortable with my glasses on after long wearing. Bose might not have such good sound quality but it is more comfortable to wear  when wearing with glasses.", "Sound quality - incredible.Noise cancelling - very good. I have building work going on next door, and these headphones bring most of the noise pretty close to silence (can still hear muffled drilling in the adjacent room).Comfort - exceeded my expectations really - I was told these headphones aren't that comfortable to wear, compared to other headphones. Although I haven't tried 'the most comfortable headphones' on the market, I find these headphones extremely comfortable to wear. The inners have a soft velvet kind of feel, really lovely to wear.The app - great amount of customisation of sound, for example the EQ, position of sound etc etc. I believe this deep level of customisation should be standard for all headphones. Whilst many other headphone brand's focus heavily on creating the 'best' sound, ultimately, we all have our own preferences on the sound, Whilst Sony have done a amazing job of creating the best possible listening experience, the sound-customisation possibilities within the app is respectful to our preferences of sound. If you want your bass to slam, then you can, etc.Build quality - these headphones have a premium, sturdy feel - which is a fairly big achievement from Sony considering plastic is the dominant material here.Overall verdict - worth every penny. Would recommend these headphones by Sony to all.", "After a lot of research I could  not be more happy with my final choice the Sony WH-1000XM3.If you look for wireless headphones Up to \u00a3300 and an excellent quality but look anymore there is only 1 competitor to this ones  (Bose QC35 II)  and apart of the comfort which the Bose only are a bit better, this Sony for me win in every other aspect.I got to compare this Sony , Bose QC35 ll and the Beats Studio 3( this was my first choice when I start to look for Better Headphones).It not took long to eliminate the Beats from my selection, even though I\u2019m a Apple fan the headphones are really bad in quality build, sound and noise cancellation which seems to not exist in my opinion.Moving forward and with pride talking about my Sony\u2019s.The fact on the app you can personalize noice cancellation, equaliser and other settings is fantastic.It looks a bit weird at the begginning when you take pictures of your ears but after when your listen music you understand the idea is to Taylor to you.Quality of sound as music addict I couldn\u2019t be more impressed, have in mind I like various genres of music.Even though they are not build for it I go to the gym and they sit tight without hurt my head.Once again and -to resume if you are not sure try to go to a store as John Lewis or curry\u2019s pc world and try them on.", "Wanted these for use on long flights - they blocked out engine noise completely - i was shocked at how noisy the cabin was when i switched them off! Sound quality is great. The volume control (touch panel on earpiece) was a little fiddly at first - but OK once i got used to it. Especially like being able to touch the earpiece to silence music and switch off noise cancelling to talk to the attendant.", "The adaptive noise cancelling on the fly is a bit iffy but the headphones are really nice. Noise cancelling works well for trains. The 20% function allows me to talk to someone as well as enjoy my music which is great. Happy with my choice.  They look great, nice burnished Sony emblems and the padding is soft. The charging cable is about the length of a finger fyi. No Biggie though. Case is nice too and the sound is the best I've heard, especially against the Bose. Yeah happy.", "Overall, disappointed with these headphones. I chose them for the advertised  comfort and superior noise cancelling.  Unfortunately neither quality meets expectations.They arenot very comfortable for me, the headband presses on top of my head. If I extend the headband the headphones rest awkwardly on the ears trying to slip off.The biggest disappointment is noise cancelling. They do lower the noise, but listening to audio books, as loudly as is comfortable &amp; with NC activated and optimised, I can still clearly hear conversations in the next room, most distracting. My old Bose earbuds are far better at blocking outside noise. They're going with me next time I fly, not the WH1000XM3''s.On the positive side, the sound quality is very good, for music and listening to audio books.If you have the right size &amp; shape head, and generally listen to loud music, these may well be a good buy for you but for me, no.", "Firstly they are comfortable to wear for long periods, for example in an office, even when I am wearing glasses.The sound quality is overall great for me. I can hear details in the music I don't on cheaper headphones, particularly on quieter tracks. The overall sound balance is fine for me but I haven't compared to them directly with other comparable products.The noise cancelling is more intelligent than I expected. Although it cancels out ambient sounds it also allows in speech. For example on a plane it cancelled out all engine sounds but I could still hear announcements from the crew/pilot. This is configurable as well so that it cancels out all sounds - useful in an office with a lot of chatting.Battery life is great and it comes with its own carry case that also includes space for the charging cable and wired headphone connector.", "These are really good headphones, the noise cancellation is pretty darn good. If it's a really noisy environment it won't cancel it all out but they do cancel out a lot. Especially general office background noise.The sound quality I'm not totally sold on yet, I've yet to play with the app properly but I wasn't blown away by Dark side of the moon in a quiet room with noise cancellation on. Perhaps an equaliser would make them better.Price wise, with Amazon finance they're a no brainer if you are thinking of some NC headphones and can afford it.", "The xm3 are the perfect headphones for me. In comparison to xm2 and the Bose headphones, these are way better.I have been used this product for almost 2 months and they are working perfect.It is a huge improvement from the previous generation, they are lighter, the sound quality is better, I like the bass boost and the crispy clear sound.I love that I can use them with the LDAC codec. These headphones have different codecs for the best sound quality experience.The connectivity is pretty stabilised, I really don't have problems with it. The only issue here is switching between different devices. I think other product are way smart when it comes to switching between devices. Maybe a firmware update will fix this issue. I appreciate the NFC connection.The noise cancelling is good, but not the best. I like I have different options and I really appreciate the Adaptive sound control.Swiping is ok, but not the best. You need time to get used with this.Overall it is a very good product.", "One of the best headphone investments I've made in a long time! I work in a busy office and these headphones allow me to concentrate on my work. Sound quality is amazing and configurable which is a fantastic. Best of all is that these are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time!The product quality is second to none, these headphones look and feel luxurious compared to other noise cancelling headphones. Lastly the battery life for these is amazing and they charge fairly quickly too!I would highly recommend these to anyone thinking of getting noise cancelling headphones.", "Had been looking for noise cancelling headphones for a while and was expecting to end up with Bose QC ones when I read that these were considered to be the best on the market at the moment.They don't disappoint! Superb sound with rich base and the settings let you fully tailor the sound to your specific liking. The noise cancelling seems very good so far but haven't tried them on a plane as yet.They are comfortable to wear and easy on the ear. I would recommend them.", "I'd you are unsure on these just get them. They are so good. Everything about them is great. The look, the feel, the quality are brilliant. I really didn't plan on spending this much but so glad I did. Hopefully they'll last me years. I use them on a noisy trains, tubes and buses and all the background noise is minimal. Sometimes it feels surreal how quiet it can be", "If these headphones had consistent performance I would have given them 5/5.The bluetooth connection for me is sometimes good and other-times terrible, incredibly inconsistent.Which makes it frustrating to listen to music at times.My Previous bluetooth earphones although sounded far worse, but were very consistent, never stuttered or stopped during playback. So I don't think it's a fault my end.I just expected considering how much money these cost their performance would be great.", "My first set had a roaring sound coming from the left earcup after a single trip on holiday. Amazon did a return and I spun the wheel for a second try and wasn't disappointed the new pair has been flawless and brings a lot of joy to air and rail travel, as well as a noisy open plan office. Even without any power and cabled up to a computer they are actually passable in a pinch. No regrets so far, honestly if you've never had noise cancelling before the jump to this is like magic. You can just remove all the irritation and stress from most powered travel. Even with no music playing, wearing them on a plane is simply fantastic.", "Having tried the Sony WI-1000X earphones which had excellent sound quality ( had to return as they kept falling out of my ears ), decided to try the Sony WH-1000XM3. While the set up was easy and Noise-Cancelling was excellent I found that the Sound left a lot to be desired, the bass was brilliant, but the treble sounded muted, which adjustments to the equaliser failed to solve, resulting in the sound sounding dull and flat, also found that after a short time my ears became hot and sweaty. Going back to my AirPods who\u2019s bass is no where as detailed but in comparison sound vibrant and alive.", "I own these headphones and a pair of TaoTronic BH-22 headphones, there is approximately \u00a3200 difference in price between them (TaoTronics were just over 30 quid), but the difference in sound is so incredibly marginal that I cannot understand why anyone would waste their money on these.The sound is good, noise-cancelling is better than the TaoTronics without any music playing, but little difference when music is playing as this blocks any sound anyway.Build quality is better on the XM3s but the touch buttons are very hit and miss.The microphone on the XM3s is ok, it appears I was one of the fortunate few who receive a pair with a semi-functioning microphone but the BH-22 microphone is far superior.For clarification, I am running version 2.0 of the firmware so this is not the issue. I have tried version 4.0 as well.TLDR; I believe these headphones are massively overhyped and you can pick up something only slightly worse for a ~\u00a3200 saving.", "So far I am in love with these. This is the 3 LTD type of noise cancelling g headphones I\u2019ve tried over the years. So far there are no issues with this one but from past experience with competitors one usually has to wait about a year to experience issues with these devises.These are much more comfortable than the momentum, bowers and Wilkins or Bose. Wore them for 9 hours straight and my ears did not hurt from the headphones like they did with all other ones.", "Everything about these is impressive. They look, feel, and work beautifully. I needed noise-cancelling and a lot of bass - Sony delivered. 'Quick Attention' is one of the best features for me: I used to have it fiddle about with my Beats trying to pause playback or take my headphones off completely if someone started talking to me, but with Quick Attention I can place my palm over one side of the headphones; the noise-cancelling turns off and the volume goes all the way down so I can have a quick conversation. As soon as I lift my hand away, playback resumes as normal. Incredibly convenient and a lot less disruptive.Possible downside is they're larger/bulkier than I expected, so they look a little too oversized. Regardless, they're very lightweight and the overall aesthetic is great.Also pleased with the case it came with, which has little compartments for the auxiliary and charger cables.", "Well what can I say. Believe the hype! I own many headphones from Bowers &amp; Wilkins, Bose, Sennheiser, Oppo and Bang &amp; Olusen... An addict some might say and these are now my go-to pair. I like the feel of these. Very light, you could go in depth about the sound of these but there's no need. They just sound 'right'. They are exciting to listen to. Very high quality. The noise cancelling is just amazing. I have two very noisy extractor fans in my work kitchen. Once these are on..... Bye bye fans. They are that good. Well done Sony", "Although the noise cancellation and battery life is excellent, the built-in microphone is unusable for phone calls. The sound quality is significanly worse than talking to your phone. I would expect more for this price. If at least it was possible to disable the built in mics and use the phone's mic while still listening through headphones...Make sure you test the mic if you buy these!", "These are consistently rated the best noise cancelling headphones by a numbers of tech reviewers and I can see why. Even in comparison to the previous generation they are a step up.Noise cancelling is great and the sound is superb for most types of music. Even the quality of sound when making phone calls is amazing. At the recent prices they are a steal and you won't regret it.", "I was torn between these and the new Bose ones and i am glad I spent for the tried and tested ones.Easy to connect and operate with one button, so comfortable and soft so they don\u2019t hurt after a whileThe noise cancelling is great and it doesn\u2019t hurt like my cheap and Cherie pair, i could wear these all day with no issues.All in all i am pleased i went for these and love them.", "The best thing I have ever bought. Got them for 230 pounds on black Friday and have loved them since. The active noise cancelling is amazing and the sound quality is insanely good too. I have only charged them twice since I bought them even while using them for several hours a day, the battery seems to never end. Absolutely recommend these headphones especially if you can get them on sale.", "Honestly amazed by these the sound quality is just out of this world really is I use them with my iPhone and iPad and I downloaded the Sony headphone connect app and you can really customize the way you want to hear them they feel so so premium I was worried if my head was too big for these and the clamping would be too much but if anything they are little lose so if you have a big head and a wide head these will fit perfectly", "I got these as a present to myself for Christmas, I'd been promising myself a new set of headphones all year, and did lots of research into what might be the best option, and once again Sony came up trumps with their technology.  My sons have different models of Beats headphones, and these Sony phones are streets ahead.", "Sound: greatNoise cancellation: outstandingOnly issue is that when on a call (phone call or internet call through app) the other party hears my sound muffled, and I can hear the ambient noise around me being amplified through the headphones despite setting it to Noise Cancelling. After hanging up, it returns to proper playback and noise cancelling appropriately.Called Sony for a replacement, they could only offer that I send it off to a repair center.Amazon promised me a replacement, but then told me they can only offer a return and refund.Quite disappointed.", "At the moment of writing this review, I have already a few months of using the headphones almost daily. On the daily basis I use them at the office, even without any music, just for NC. Helps me concentrate. Have used them on the plain. It will not be completely quiet but it will cut out about 80% of the noise, which is fantastic.Pairing with the phone is very easy - with the help of NFC, but I paired them with the TV, tablet without any problem.Bottom line : I recommend this headphones 100% !!!", "Sadly I have had to return these headphones for a full refund as they are not compatible with my Google Pixel 3 XL mobile phone.  I could only listen to music or audio for around 5-6 seconds before it would start crackling and \"dropping out\".  Friends have paired it with their iphones and had absolutely no problems so I can only imagine it is an Bluetooth incompatibility issue with the Google phone so I'd be interested to hear if anyone else has had similar problems. I am really disappointed as they are great headphones but I have tried everything and can't make them work with my phone.", "Always heard good thing about this headphones. Was sceptical at first but once I tried it. I was blown away.The main thing is the noise cancelling. It\u2019s truly amazing. Highly recommend this when travelling on any public transport.Also it passes the phone pocket test. Keeping my phone in my trouser pocket and using these headphones without any skipping.Sound quality is great. Really feel like you\u2019re in the music. Coupled with noice cancelling, I hear every beat of the song.Get it. You won\u2019t regret it.", "Honestly I couldn\u2019t have asked for better!I have mental health problems and need these to feel less overwhelmed in public transport and in the outside world in general, and they work perfectly at canceling most noises. Even without music, you will hear the difference between having no earphones, putting them on (the over ear pads already diminish outside noises) and then turning it on. The sound and music quality is the best I\u2019ve known (and I use to own over ears Monster Beats Studio earphones).One little thing though: if you are prone to travel sickness ( car sickness, etc...) you might like me, feel dizzy and a bit nauseated at first, especially if you just have them on without any music. That\u2019s because of the sound frequencies the earphones use to cancel out outside noise and how it interacts with your inner ear. Just don\u2019t wear them for long period of times without any music on, or wear only one ear and let a bit of outside noise come in. You get used to it after a while anyway.", "I have had a few different pairs of headphones over the last few years. The sound quality is fine. What you're paying for with these is convenience and the noise canceling. I bought these because I got fed up of carrying around a headphone amplifier and having cables dangling around everywhere. They don't sound as good as Audio Technica m-50s or Beyerdynamic DT770 PROs which would both be cheaper but they block out pretty much all background noise on planes and on the train, the Bluetooth connectivity is flawless and battery life is insane. I charged them up twice on a 2-week beach holiday.  It's really a choice between these and Bose QCs I think these are better. I think the Bose sound slightly better with a flatter response (but these are not bought for purse sound quality)  these are much better in all other areas. Comfort, touch controls, Battery life, charging speed and best noise canceling I have personally used.", "I've had these about a week now and am really enjoying them. They're comfortable, although they do interfere a little with my glasses, and the noise cancelling feature is satisfyingly effective.The only irksome feature is the length of the charging cable. It's only 15cm long (6 inches), which makes plugging it in to recharge in the back of my Mac really a silly fiddle. For equipment of this quality and price this oversight, or scrimping on materials, seems bizarre. What were Sony thinking when they decided that this was a practical and useful length?", "Bought these to replace Bose QC35\u2019s which were stolen- really glad I did.  I\u2019ve just listened to them for 15 hours solid on a flight and they still have 70% battery left. Really comfortable and I\u2019m picking out parts of songs I didn\u2019t notice with the Bose.I also bought them with 5 x monthly payments of \u00a366 with Amazon rather than get them duty free at the airport. Couldn\u2019t believe they\u2019re only \u00a310 cheaper at Heathrow  duty free. Makes Amazon look like even more of a bargain.", "As noise cancellation headphones, I can\u2019t fault them because I haven\u2019t found better (the alternatives sacrifice sound quality).My problem with them is the poor responsiveness of the playback controls. For a smooth surface, the gesture should matter more than the touch location... otherwise it needs different tactile \u2018feeling\u2019 for the play/pause control, as a reference point. These things matter if you use the headphone during vigorous exercise and don\u2019t like being interrupted just to change the music.", "Good sound considering the price and how much tech is packed into these headphones but depending on taste you might want to adjust the bass between 32 and 650 Hz with a 10 band equaliser to -5 dB so you can actually hear the drums. Instant Bluetooth connection, clean vocals, decent touch-pad controls...Unbeatable for NC Bluetooth headphones at their price point.", "Headphones are fine, but purchased from Argos as the ones I ordered from Amazon were stolen in transit and the box clumsily re-sealed.Hinges became a little creaky after a while but easily fixed with a dab of silicone lubricant.Sound quality and noise cancelling certainly an improvement over my previous Bose QC models - let\u2019s hope that the longevity is better.", "I recently bought a pair of Sony 700 s they were very good but the noise cancelling wasnt. I decided on these though a lot more expensive. The difference is night and day. I work in a factory where i need the noise cancelling and these deliver.Very expensive but the sound and connectivity is worth it. Comfy to wear too and i have worn them for maybe 8hrs and the battery says its still at 90 per cent. Pretty good piece of kit", "Having tried most of the top-brand ANC headphones, I ended up keeping the Sony.Why? Simply because they are the best in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation.The touch controls are very easy to use as well, and having the dedicated button for ANC means you don't need to use the app all the time.I'm extremely happy with them, well worth the price.", "Great set of wireless cans. Better noise cancelling &amp; much better sound than the bose quiet comfort 35II. The only issue i have with them is the touch controls on the right ear cup, much too sensitive, leading to accidental play, pause or skipping of tracks. Comfortable, relatively lightweight &amp; quick &amp; long lasting charge. They support aptx &amp; ldac if you have compatible sources to take full advantage of them. Would recommend to anyone looking for a great pair of wireless headphones with the budget for them.", "I debated for a long time on getting a pair of Bose or similar &amp; did quite a bit of comparing. Then I stumbled across these ones &amp; it was the reviews that led me to purchase a pair.  Zero regrets. They are fantastic. They are very comfy, fit around my ears perfectly, they fold so they can be stowed more easily &amp; the case is pretty decent too. They are excellent at blocking ambient sound, greatly reduce the sound of voice too &amp; I find the intuitive control on one of the ears by a swipe or tap of a finger very easy &amp; responsive. Maybe a choice of more colours would make it a little more of a personal buy but I think they\u2019re absolutely brilliant.", "Love these!Completely blocks out the neighbours when they're using their noisy garden tools or cutting the grass, blocks out noisy kids playing next door, too. Well worth the money just for the peace they provide!", "Product worked brilliantly for the first 24 hours then I started getting a very annoying sound in the left ear a bit like a strong wind blowing. This is definitely an issue with the active noise cancelling as whenever I turn that off, the sound goes away and I can still listen to my music.A look through the Sony support forums reveals that this is a very common issue. Sometimes blamed on a hardware failure and sometimes blamed on firmware. Either way, not something I will accept from a premium priced product such as this.", "These were bought to replace an aging pair of Bose headphone that I bought 4 years ago and have been used each day. I spent around a month looking at what was on the market and narrowed down to either these or Bose QuietComfort 35. I tried each of them and was knocked out by the quality and comfort of the Sony\u2019s. There is nothing bad about the Bose pair but I felt the Sony had the edge in the sound and fit. This is down to personal preference but they met all the criteria that I had set down before looking. The noise cancelling is the best I have ever used and will eliminate most noise especially when on the tube or bus. The battery life is exceptional and in a normal week I don\u2019t need to charge them in fact they will go for a couple of weeks with charging.The app for them is useful as its does allow further customisation of the sound and other functions.Would I recommend them\u2026.yes!", "Keep it short and sweet . Because these don't even deserve any of my time ...Headphones went back after 2 daysfor this price ! i expect perfection and these are anything but  perfect !technically ...OK. Yes yes  the noise crenelation etc  etc blah blah works very well  and i mean very WELL. Sorry Bose there is  just no competitionBUT and this is a big butthey feel \u00a350 !the headband is too tight and too slim and the plastic used is terribly cheap looking ! these are NOT worth \u00a3260 . Not even closeMy \u00a360 sennnheiser have a better feel and lookI don't believe how anyone can say these are decent for the priceThey are not !Totally  overpriced with a cheap cheap feel and look !", "And you're not skint, then these are the headphones for you!  I used them on a flights from UK to China, China to Japan and then back to the UK, all on one charge!  The noise cancellation has to be heard to be believed ... pardon the pun.  I can't rate these highly enough.  I'd have given the volume control a 5, except it's picky (or I'm using it wrong), so I slaved it up to Siri instead.", "Howdy, I am an old skool dj and I must say that my turn to headphones were always a set of wired sennheiser hd25, amazing headphones, maybe not so for bass, but for everything else! Since getting these badboys, I must admit that I have been pleasantly surprised, they are very good headphones, a good dollop of bass, good mid and treble too. If you downloaded the app, then you get a graphic equaliser too... I am not a Sony fan typically, but these headphones are good, rest assured. But with confidence people!", "These are the first pair of noise-cancelling headphones I've bought, and I was really impressed for the first week or so. After that, I found that if I'd been wearing the headphones for a couple of hours, and I was using the noise cancellation, there was a persistent crackling in the right earpiece, which over the next week became much louder and more noticeable. Searching online seems to indicate that this is a known problem, but without a resolution so far. Sony's recommendations to reset and reinitialise the headphones did not help at all. The problem only appears (somewhat ironically) while noise cancellation is activated.Ultimately, I expected better from a pair of headphones at this price, and have been left quite disappointed. I'll be returning these headphones back to Amazon first thing tomorrow, and replacing them with another company's product.", "Should have bought these headphones earlier. They are comfortable, with excellent NC and Ambient Sound activation- that make a difference. The finger swiping for volume control and song skip was easy to get used to. I 1000% recommend.", "Compared to the original MDR-1000X - USB-C, even better noise cancelling, better configurable audio quality.Excellent battery life and bluetooth signal. Never had a drop.Only downside is the audio quality when the headphones are being used as a microphone, it downgrades to telephone quality!!! I always have to use laptop mic when using these headphones for video calls.", "Man i know what you are thinking, \u00a3300 odd for a pair of headphones...... well they are 100% worth it!The sound quality is amazing, they look super clean and are super comfy to wear - battery lasts very very long, sometimes i go a week or two and they are still not needing a charge. The controls are simple enough once you get the hang of it an they feel super solid.Best purchase of headphones i have made, and i have had a few in my time.", "Tried these for the first time on a transatlantic flight and they were amazing. Sound quality whilst listening/watching movies but also the noise cancelling was amazing for sleeping! Better than ear plugs!Really glad I bought the Sony as well, very chic design and colour (champagne colour) with the swipe finger control over the ear piece-brilliant, comes with a cable for normal headphone plug ins as well as Bluetooth.", "I like the bass and the looks.I think BOSE are more comfortable.Android app is ok, a bit clunky but there are some options to chose from (some of them are useless).One problem is that it sometimes can't cope with wind as good as BOSE.I'm still gonna keep this over BOSE because it's cheaper and looks nicer (I like the look).", "The noise cancellation simply does not live up to the hype.A pair of 3 year old Bose headphones has better ANC than these, which is quite disappointing as I really enjoyed the comfort and sound quality of the WH-1000XM3.Many say that this is a firmware issue. However, I have no frame of reference as my headphones came pre-installed with the latest firmware (4.1.1), but the noise cancelling was awful. I could hear birds chirping outside, cars on the street, and people chatting across the street. I've returned these and will wait either for a fix or a better product on the market.", "The noise cancelling headphones made grunting and farting noises. Then a long winded process to get Sony service to understand these were new units - after the wanted to charge out of warranty.Still waiting for headphones after 8 weeks.", "I never thought music could sound so good! Choons I've been listening to for decades sound fresh and new and so much better than ever before.It is as though I am in a space with the artists, it's incredible. The music and the voices are crystal clear and the sounds come from all around me. Totally awesome!! I cannot big the headphones up enough!! They have blown my mind. Seriously!!! \ud83e\udd2f\ud83d\ude01My advice would be to treat yourself.The touch controls are SO easy to use and my ears get warm but certainly not too hot.Bravo Sony, bravo!!", "As per the other reviews these are truly excellent headphones. The noise cancelling is superb along with the battery life. They pair instantly everyone to my phone or tablet and the quality of sound is exceptional. The touch interface gesture control on the side is very easy to use and the covering of the whole ear with your hand, activates a mode which allows you to hear everything around you, which is very clever as it uses the headphone microphones. The only slight annoyance is the auto mode that determines if you are walking or sitting and activates different levels of noise cancelling. It works well but is slow to respond. You can turn it off though and cycle through them manually. A very minor gripe on what are amazing headphones. Very pleased I went for these ones.", "I spent a lot of time deliberating as to whether to upgrade to the QC35'S. I will give Bose this, they do edge out sony in terms of comfort. No doubt about it for my big head and big ears the Bose do sit more snug. Took me about an hour to get used to wearing the Sony's but they are still comfortable all the same. Regarding sound however theres doubt (in my opinion) the Sony's are better. The noise cancellation is the best I've come across and the EQ/ Optimization feature allows me to tweak everything to how I like it. Brought the best out of my favourite albums. The bass bounces but it does cut out the treble to do so.The optimisation also allows you to tweak settings automatically for when you are in different places, at home, on the bike or on a busy platform.Waiting to see if they will deliver the 30hrs as boasted but aside from that I'm a happy customer.", "I've owned Beats studio, Audio Technica M50x, Bose QCiiThese are my new favourite set of headphones.Slightly heavier than the bose, but feel more solid on the head.  Ears have yet to over heat.  Good sound quality similar to bose but the sony are more customisable...I'm not an sound technician so dont know the technical words but I know what sounds I prefer - basically easier to adjust on the sony apEasy to connect bluetooth.Very quick charge time.Recommend over bose personally.", "After reading a lot of reviews and spending a lot of time weighing these against the XM2s, I decided on the XM3s. I am really happy with them. The noise cancelling, sound quality, build quality and battery life are excellent. Some people complain about the app and the voice that confirms user actions but both are fine for me, I even like the voice!", "Literally, everything about these headphones is incredible. A lot more fun to listen to compared to Bose, touch works well for me, comfortable, the app has updated so you can remove spoken notifications etc.The main area where Sony has really not cared for is the build. The right hinge (where the touchpad is based) ends up constantly creaking. I've already had to return one pair and it seems to have already popped up again so will have to return these too!If you search for these headphones then add 'hinge' to it you'll see reddit threads galore full of the same issue.So close to being perfect but constant creaking in my ear is really the last thing I want.", "For:Noise cancelling great once set through app. Sound quality good. Comfortable to wear. Batterylife exceptional.Against:Not sure what Sony were thinking when they decided to not have buttons for vol, skip, start stop and calls. At gym it's just too easy to touch the headphone control surface with your arm and trigger something Aagh!!!", "Best headphones I've ever owned. I have spent a small fortune trying endless different headphones over the years but never found a pair I really liked. I wish I had just spent the money on these sooner as they are near perfect. Comfortable, great sound quality and the battery life is excellent. Would recommend these to anybody without hesitation.", "Got these to use at work (open plan office, you know how it is).Terribly disappointed to find they don't actually work on Macs.On Mojave and Catalina they don't show up under the list of discoverable devices. Sony, as per usual, are being terrible at customer support and just saying \"hold down power for 7 seconds, follow OS instructions for pairing...\" on repeat. Refusing to acknowledge there's an issue.Sound's awesome, NC works incredibly well even when you'd think it wouldn't, battery life is pretty great too and they're quick to charge as well.If only I could use them with my computer rather than having to go to my phone.Verdict:- if you don't have a Mac that you care about using these with, buy.- if you'd like something you can use with your non-ancient Mac, look somewhere else.", "Its very good , noise cancelling drowns out some sounds more than others , sound is good but not as good as a wired pair of Audio Technica M50x  , the touch controls for volume and forward/reverse/next ect  are rubbish - bring back buttons that react when you press them not this soft touch maybe it works if you rub it right rubbish - the Bose QC35 wins on that one for sure .", "Headphones are very subjective but for me these are the best pair I have owned.Build quality and package quality are fantastic.The sound quality and noice cancellation are brilliant, totally immersive and to me they sound fantastic.  I have a couple of pairs of Bose as well as Turtle Beach X800 and these are better sound as well as lighter on your head - I bought them as a return from the Amazon Warehouse and they arrived pristine - more than happy to recommend to anyone.", "Absolutely love these, got them after my old cheaper sonys finally gave up on me after 5 years.ANC is top notch, used them on a 4 hour flight and had no complaints at all.Suitable for office use as well thanks to ambience control.Sound quality is very good, I\u2019m not an audiophile by any means so others may disagree but they suit my needs down to a tee.", "Loved this on the planes and trains, cuts out almost all cabin noise. Good loud volume and settings. Sits quite comfortably. My main issue is that the Alexa control is not built in, it uses the mobile phone alexa so that all needed to be running separately. I also cannot connect it to my \u00a31500 tv or my PS4 pro, so it kind of means I wont be able to use it as much as I would like.", "These have a lot going for them. But to my ears they collapsed the soundstage significantly, and for some of the genres I favor it was not a good match. That closeness may be a by-product of or accentuated the lean toward the bass and low frequencies in all the genres of music I tried. The noise cancelling is excellent. Maybe too good.", "After having had Bose, and Dre Beats I bought these on an impulse purchase...... and OMG!!!What a pair of headphones these are. Totally awesome, battery life is amazing 3 days of play at almost 5 hours a day! The noise cancelling is adjustable, and sound quality better than anything else out there!", "Pros:Good Base quality,Noise cancelling,Battery life andFitting on the ears without painCons:Side invisible buttons aren't working properly.sweating accumulate near ear sometimes though not used for a long time.Product design not stylish because I have a budget bluetooth headset that does have better lookOverall it's serve the purpose well", "On first listening these sound pretty good, not amazing but still decent. Nice bass and decent clarity but as I bought these for flights thecNC has to be good and on these they are superb! Not tried on a flight as yet but even in and around home they block out pretty much everything. At the price of just \u00a3260 great price/quality ratio so would highly recommend.", "These are by far the best headphones I have ever tried and owned!They maybe a little pricey, but trust me, they are worth EVERY penny.The noise cancelling is exceptional, the battery life is phenomenal and the sound quality truly is second to none.They are brilliant quality and amazingly comfortable to wear, even for extended periods.The only small issue I have with these headphones is that once you have them paired with a device, it\u2019s quite a faff to pair them with another device, but this is only a very small point, and someone with better technical knowledge than me, would probably be able to carry this out with no issues!I\u2019m so pleased I made the investment in these, and I\u2019ve been over the moon with all aspects of this product.", "Simply the best out there. Really comfortable, great battery life, loads if features including dynamic noise cancellation or just full on cancellation. Touch controls and best of all great sound. These are consistently reviewed the best band for buck noise cancelling headphones on the market for 2019. They don't disappoint at all.", "Was able to compare these with the B&amp;O H9i for a few weeks side -by-side. Yes, these are the best at ANC but with music playing, most if not all headphones at this price range will be good at ANC. Unless, of course, you only wear headphones to blockout outside noise? If so, these are a clear winner.  If sound and build quality is your thing, there are better out there. I sent these back in the end and kept my H9i.", "DO NOT UPDATE THE FIRMWARE ONCE YOU BROUGHT THIS!!!! It will mess up the ANC!!!", "I use Jabra 80, so I tried Bose 35ii, Bose 25, and those. For noise cancelling Bose is best for office work. Sony fails with low call quality... People asked me to switch back to Jabra headphones I use typically. Bose 25 has suitable mic but one Jabra has is best.", "I wanted a high quality noise cancelling product, as I catch the tube each day to work, and recent reports highlight the damage the noise of the tube does to users hearing, so clearly I wanted something to help with this, but also let me carry on listening to music.These are gems! By no means is it absolutely silent when on the tube, but once your music is playing, it\u2019s pretty close! First time I put them on I was stunned how good it was.Can\u2019t recommend them enough if you have a noisy commute on the train/tube and need some peace and quiet.", "OMG! These headphones are one of the best I\u2019ve ever used. Before buying I read a lot of reviews and watched YouTube videos on this model and every review praised it. Took the plunge and I couldn\u2019t have been happier. I use these on my long haul flights a lot and once noise cancelling is activated you can\u2019t hear a single thing.", "Great headphones.I love the ability to personalise them through the app. Noise cancellation is great, much more effective then Sennheiser PXC550 and on par with, maybe even better than Bose\u2019s. Sound is very accurate with perfect stereo separation. Battery lasts long and is quick to charge. Design is great and they are quite comfy. All in all, these headphones are all you could wish for in mid-segment market headphones.", "The technology in this thing is amazing - I love every aspect of it. It's comfy, it blocks out the children people bring on planes, and has great sound. I find it awkward to walk with them though (they tend to fall forward a bit) but I wouldn't wear them outside of an airport anyway because someone will definitely nick them. But great for commuting and worth every penny.", "Great headphones however for me being able to be connected to 2 devices at once is a must so I had to send them back for this reason only. To be clear you can pair to upto 8 devices with the headphones however you have to disconnect from the device you are connected to, before connecting to another. I needed to be connected to my phone for phone calls while at the same time being conected to my laptop for WebEx meetings. I have now purchased the Bose 700.", "Causing discomfort as the foam is quite thin.  The other thing I noted was that the frame is a bit creaky when wearing.  I really wanted to keep these but the inside speaker cover just sits on my eyes making them uncomfortable.  With thicker pads, these would be 5 star all day long.", "Noise cancellation is excellent with these headphones and sound quality is excellent dependent of course on the quality of the track you are listening to - trouble is most streamed music is of generally average quality so you don't really get the benefit of them...Comes with a durable headphone case...I would recommend these headphones..", "I received my pair of these Sony's with much excitement. However as soon as I have them on my head and start fiddling with the noise cancellation there is a very obvious constant white noise in the right ear only. After searching on the internet it appears this is a surprisingly common problem - in the right ear.Apart from that they're an acceptable pair of headphones, not particularly comfortable, but lacking in treble details, but that's the kind of thing you get used to, or play with the equalizer in the app for.I have no doubt I'd learn to love these headphones had I not received a faulty pair. Don't think I'll buy online again.", "I bought these to avoid spending hundreds and thousands on hifi... which I\u2019ve done earlier in my life. So these needed to be high quality and superb sound quality ultimately. I\u2019ve also upgraded my online music source from Spotify to Tidal, which allows me to play much higher quality source material and this in itself has made a huge impact on all the devices I listen through. These are comfortable, the app works well, and o use them to listen from both my iPhone and my laptop without issue. Very, very happy with the purchase. After reading other reviews rating these against the similarly priced Bose phones I believe I chose well and have no regrets at all.", "These are worth every penny and you get exactly what you pay for. Sound quality is superb. Noise cancelling is exceptional and blocks virtually all sounds out (living next to a rail line and close to heathrow airport ).The only negative I can find in them is that they are a little on the bulkier side", "It's beats Bose and BW etc hands down in sound. But build quality could have been better but plastic construction makes it lighter so no big deal. One happy customer. Let's see long term how it performs.", "Simply the best headphones I've ever had the noise cancelling works brilliantly very comfortable to wear nice build quality comes with a very nice hard case but most of all they sound great think that they are worth the price", "After 4 months of use, I\u2019m very pleased with the overall quality of the Sony WH-1000XM3. These were bought on the recommendations of reviews from various tech based websites and Which? Magazine. The build quality is quite robust considering the amount of tech incorporated into these cans. Sound quality is elite level for this price range, and although the swipe and tap controls can at times take a couple of tries to operate or master they\u2019re great additions. Noise cancelling reduces outside interference to a minimum and your ears become subjected to an almost vacuum like quietness. Battery life is also very good with 27 hours of operating life before recharging. Overall this is a fantastic pair of headphones and my work commutes have never been more enjoyable.", "This is second pair i got so wife has a set. Used it flying long distance on planes. The noise cancelling is great cuts out engine and other noises. With wires provided able to use with onboard entertainments so much better than using ordinary earphones. The app on iphone is really useful. Batterry life do far has been good although o havent tested it to its limits. Overall a great headphone just rather expensive", "These headphones are fantastic, they are especially good on the Tube and airplanes were the  noise can be very loud and constant.  The tap to pause is sometimes a little unresponsive, but that is the only little niggle I've had, and I have used them almost daily for 4 months.  I can absolutely recommend these.", "Best ANC headphones you can get right now. The sound quality is amazing for Bluetooth and ANC headphones. They are comfortable enough to ware for a full transatlantic flight. Noise cancelling is as good as it gets. Only let downs are switching between connected devices is not as easy as it should be and I find the sound a little lacking in the mid to highs. However the EQ in the app fixed the latter. Sound quality is great. Would highly recommend.", "I can't leave my house without wearing these headphones due to the amazing quality of them that just allows you to be 'in the zone' where you can be disconnected or integrated with your surroundings alongside your favourite tunes. 100% recommend these to those who constantly use public transport, work in quite or loud places and those that love to be in a 'zone'.", "Thought long and hard about buying these cans - the Bose Q35 ii had my attention given the Bose name and rep - after reading all the reviews and testing both I went with my head rather than heart and purchased the Sony's. Best decision ever! These are easily the best headphones money can but today - The Bose are great - the Sonys are unbeatable. Worth every penny.", "Pretty much perfect in every away apart from one thing...... They were uncomfortable on the side of my head. they sound great, the noise canceling is awesome and I love the touch technology. Ended up sending them back and am now the happy owner on the Bose QC35ii Headphones. Maybe not quite up there with the Sony's but very close, and they can't be beaten for comfort and that was of paramount importance to me.", "Fantastic headphones I have many the Sony XM2 B&amp;W 5,7,PX the Nuraphones the B&amp;O H9 plus many more I\u2019m rather sad but these are the best all round package whether being used Bluetooth with my iPhone or used wired with the Chord Mojo the subtleties are beyond compare I know sound is subjective but they really are fabulous my only caveat is the build quality next to similar priced headphones such as the Px\u2019s or the H9\u2019s even the Nuraphones they leave a lot to be desired but for pure unadulterated sound they are the pair I reach for most when immersing myself into the joys of one of life\u2019s foremost pleasures MUSIC .", "Phenomenal headphones. Not tried the Bose Qc35ii to compare, but tried the Sony h900ns. Sound quality comparable, perhaps even a touch better in the h900s, but these are undoubtedly more comfortable and the noise cancelling is out of this world. No pressure effect either which I have experienced with others. Fully recommend this if you want the best NC phones and can afford them.", "Thought I would treat myself to a good pair of headphones as I love my music and have seen favourable video reviews on YouTube, the sound quality is fantastic with a great bass sound and you can tweak the sound by using the app. Wireless performance is great as is battery life and the noise cancelling is good too. They are charged by a USB c cable and charge quickly too. All in they are a fantastic set of headphones.", "Great product however, the box they come with is not well thought out. Also, the volume control etc is rubbish. Sound quality is excellent but they\u2019re difficult to use and not as easy as my BOSE 35\u2019s, which are just a bit tatty now, hence the change. Going to send them back and buy something else, probably some more BOSE 35\u2019s, or whatever they\u2019ve been superseded  by.", "The xm3 is better than the xm2 with clearer sound. However the noise cancelling has a strong hiss which is louder than the older model. Comfortable and good battery life.", "These headphones are well made. Everything works well. Except they don't sound anything like as good as my 15 year old wired Sennheisers and the noise cancelling whilst very good is not capable of cancelling out the sound of the television when I want silence or to listen to music or audible book.Sent back the next day.", "Best headphones I've owned, and I've had a few. Much better than my astro a50s, turtle beach, grado's and old Sony mdr-1a which these replace. I was blown away with the features and sound quality on this set. They are quite expensive, but worth every penny imho. Buy cheap, buy twice. Good job Sony.", "A truly excellent product.I won't waste your time here, as there are some very detailed reviews that I read before purchasing.I will say I fully agree and these are excellent sound quality, good battery life (worldwide flights and still a lot of charge left),Have been using over a year and still pleased as punch with them.Train, bus, sat quiet.. Works great wherever.", "Superb sound from these headphones. Rarely use the noise cancellation as for indoor use only. They fit snugly on my head and deliver a good sound regardless of the music source. I use with the Sony Walkman 16 and the A&amp;K Junior players, A good buy and with a robust carrying case ideal for travelling.", "Every single time I listen to music that I've known for a while but haven't heard through these headphones, it is a revelation.  How could I have owned such a music collection for years, and never actually heard it properly?  I feel like I've been insulting the artists all this time, because whatever I was listening to, it wasn't their original artistic vision.  At least I can start making up for it now.  Now I can actually listen to music for real.", "I\u2019ve been using these for a while now, on a number of flights and trains, overground and underground. The noise cancellation is very good, and particularly noticeable on the noisier parts of the London Underground. They enable a good listen at much lower volumes. The sound quality is very good, as is the fit. No drop outs over Bluetooth, where my phone is most often in my pocket. Would recommend, for me these are very good value for money.", "My beats studio 3 broke and I needed a replacement. I bought these. The audio quality, active noise cancellation and quality of materials is far superior.The only drawback is that volume control is done with touch controls. On the move it is tricky to swipe accurately up/down to adjust the volume. Instead it registers left/right which switches tracks.", "Really enjoy listening to these headphones. Very comfortable while worn, after a while it\u2019s quite easy to forget you have them on.Sound quality out for the box was \u201cmeh\u201d but I used the Sony headphone app to tweak the EQ to my liking.Noise cancelling is unmatched and I love being able to cup the right earpiece to instantly hear my surroundings.Touch controls are fine, but the angle of the ear cup means they can sometimes be hard to utilise due to the touch surface not being exactly where you think it is.", "Not blown away. Noise cancellation felt worse than in my QC35. My ears were touching the speakers, which was uncomfortable and not great seeing as my ears aren\u2019t massive. Returned after initial try.", "Use these regularly on the London tube.  Generally noise cancellation works well but sometimes even the tube can make so much noise that the Sony's can't cope but is definitely a lot quieter than it would be if I wasn't wearing them!  Reckon they are the best on the market statistics the moment. Very happy with them.", "To be honest I was not sure whether to go for these or the Bose 700.I wish I had chosen Bose as these are ok but the ability to switch from one device to another is inferior, the NC is unnecessarily complicated and the headset seems heavier and tighter on ears. Also, so far, the sound keeps stopping briefly on connection with SONY TV.", "Great product BUT auto turn off after 5 mins is not fit for purpose !No good for long flights - 8 hrs plus if they turn off every 5 minsNo good for cutting my grass on my lawn tractorDon't want to have to have my phone with me all the time I'm using them !Great product but not fit for purpose and Sony user forum knows all about it not firmware  but a hardware issue :-)", "After a while saving money to get the best noise cancelling headphones on the market, I was disappointed and upset. Noise cancellation is amazing, sound quality is terriblly bad. These are supposed to be the BEST noise cancelling headphones on the market, they sound incredibly flat and the app doesn't really me them sound any better. I think reviews and experts that say they sound great have either been paid to say they are excellent or have no criteria at all about what is good or bad. They aren't worth the money. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.", "Great headphones. Sturdy build. Sleek. Good noise quality and brilliant noise cancelling. (Just to set expectations, it won't cancel ALL noise as that's a little optimistic but when playing music and on transport mode, it does a brilliant job. I'd you have a noisy tube/underground commute, you should be able to listen to a podcast without putting the volume on maximum.", "this helps me so much with neighbours and it helps my stress", "Wow, fantastic pair of headphones. Amazing battery, loads of features great noise cancelling, great sound and comfortable to wear. Although I had some Beats Studio 3\u2019s before which suit the type of music I listen to a bit better being bass heavy (house) they sound fantastic.My only gripe is when listening I get a random dinging noise which interrupts the music which I believe is just to the smart surround? Something like that which is meant to detect your surroundings and adjust accordingly. Even when I\u2019m just laid in bed however it does this, tad annoying. All in all wonderful pair of headphones would highly recommend.", "Very impressive and absolute quality.  I was quite reluctant to buy this over Bose  headphones. but I feel the difference. It has brilliant sensors for volume control and the best noise cancellation which us best for the flights.  Good battery life and easy to charge.Carry care is so bulky and not quite impressive.", "Great noise cancellation, the case is really useful, very comfortable and great app.The cons, for my taste and personal use, are the lack of clarity on mids and highs and the microphone that is pretty much unusable.Although the sound in general feels muddy and muffed to me, specially when compared to the Bose QC35 and 700 (which both lack in bass), that comes to personal preference so you may find it good to your taste:The microphone, however, is useless in most conditions. So if that is important I\u2019d rather wait for the M4 or look elsewhere.I\u2019m overall happy with my purchase.", "Pros1. Noise cancellation and active noise cancellation is superb2. On preset eq sound quality is good and high fidelity codecs are supported3. Battery life is excellent and for me as advertised4. For me active controls too work well even outside5. Very comfortableCons1. App is not particularly intuitive2. When you use the eq a lower quality codec is used3. Base on standard eq is a little muddyOverall excellent piece of kit I do not regret the purchase at all. I tired them Vs the Bose QC35 and 700 series and preferred these.", "Bought these after my Beats started to fall apart after years of use. Love these cans, the noise cancelling is top notch.My only gripe is the headband - it starts get uncomfortable after a couple of hours. I think the padding could be better, maybe make it a little wider. But it\u2019s a small gripe &amp; I\u2019ll take the trade off because the sound quality is just so good", "I've been using these for basically everything outside of the house, Cycling to work, walking to the shop etc.The bass is brilliant, midrange is great and the top end is also great. Only problem that I have with them is when the headphones touch basically anything, beit a a coat collar or something that'd nudge it into a slightly different position, the bass gets very dirty sounding. Of course this can be fixed by removing the things that nudge it or by positioning it in a way that won't get nudged.Overall, these headphones are very impressive, with completely controllable noise cancellation and brilliant sound, great battery life and comfort", "Outstanding, noice cancellation and sound quality finally balanced, Sony as always \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "Got these for my husband Dec 2018. He loves them. Great sound quality and stay charged for a long time. Expensive but build quality excellent. Would buy a pair for myself if I could afford them!", "GOOD ALL ROUND DESIGN AND SOUND. NOT FOR AUDIOPHILES BUT VERY ENTERTAINING AND ENGAGING SOUND. THE APP TO CONTROL ASPECTS OF THE SOUND SIGNATURE IS OK. TOUCH CONTROLS CAN BE A LITTLE UNRESPONSIVE SOMETIMES BUT THAT COULD BE DOWN TO ME. BATTERY LIFE IS EXCELLENT AND USB C CHARGING IS THE FUTURE. OVERALL VERY HAPPY.", "Amazing headphones, I have the v1 of these and LOVED them but I bought these in Black Friday for the wife but she prefers the v1 over these, the only thing I miss on these vs the v1 is the leather feeling touch control, it's some how more responsive on the v1 vs these but still great headphones for the price I got them at! Highly recommend.", "Very happy, if you want proper noise cancellation I think you have to pay the money. I tried some of the cheaper options (\u00a340-50), and they didn't really work. These are great. I can watch something on the laptop/iPad and don't get distracted by the TV sound, and my wife doesn't get and sound leaking from my headphones, as I don't need to turn up the volume too much, like I had to with the cheaper ones. :-)", "Noise cancellation , wearing them I can only describe as akin to Bilbo wearing the One Ring in the LoTR, the rest of the world sounds like it's gone very far away.Sound quality and build quality are excellent as well. not really got used to the gesture controls apart from holding a ear to turn off cancellation.I also use them for conference calls and (as long as you wear them the correct way around!) the microphone works very well.", "Without a doubt, the best wireless noise cancelling headphones out there. An almost perfect product in every way.Listening on ambient sound mode isn\u2019t the best as it uses microphones. At volumes above 60% people around you can hear what you\u2019re listening to, but that is the case with most headphones and 60% is more than loud enough for day to day listening.The noise cancelling is scary good, perfect for public transport and working without distractions. One of the best purchases I have ever made, highly reccomend!", "First time I've had noise cancelling headphones that really work...Also first time I ever fell asleep on a plane as a result...ever.PROs: Excellent noise cancelling effect.CON's: Expensive but worth it for the noise cancelling alone.A little tight fitting, but reasonably comfortable", "That's the best headphones I bought.The touch pad is great and noise cancellation is amazing. Helps me to focus on working in a noisy environment and I don't hear anyone. For important things people need to come by me instead of calling my name and interrupt.100% suggest.", "Cannot believe how much noise these headphones cut out - we live above a commercial kitchen and their extractor fans are very noisy. Put the headphones on &amp; the noise completely disappears - had to turn it on and off a few times as I had difficulty believing it was possible!. Sound quality is also very very good and can be adjusted using the app's graphic equaliser", "These are amazing, I have hear the wife nagging at all. Just turn on the noise cancelling and her dulcet tones just fade into pure, blissful silence.. I must have for any married man :)", "These were amazing until the latest firmware update. Noise cancelation has gotten drastically worse, from not being able to hear a thing from the surroundings to now picking up conversations, road noise, people typing in the office. Wouldn't recommend based on the deterioratiom on the ANC which was the main reason I purchased them", "Noise cancelling headphones are the new cubicles in an open plan office.It would be nice to have more volume levels, particularly at lower volumes. most of the time I just want something in the background to block out any ambient noise of my co-workersI love these, my only regret was not buying them sooner.", "These headphones are superb. I bought them for a couple of long flights and they eliminated 90% of the noise, enabling me to sleep! Great sound, comfortable to wear for a few hours and excellent battery life. Yes they are expensive but worthwhile as these prove that old saying- you get what you pay for!", "Excellent sound quality and ANC ability.The touch functions on the right speaker are very easy to use.These are the best wireless headphones I've tried,  including the Bose QC35 II.", "I would never of purchased something so expensive even though I love my music, except that my brother-in-law had some and shared them. These earphones are fantastic. They are fabulous for travelling with, are very comfortable and the battery lasts ages. If you love your music and want to invest they are well worth it.", "This is a absolutely beautiful and brilliant headphones,for noise cancelling,and the beautiful sound when you want to enjoy it,I really enjoyed used them ,the battery life is more than brilliant and the quality of the sound just perfect,I have hard time to compare them with Bose but I'm very happy,my only issue is the touch control ,is very sensitive and I'm wondering how long will work and depending how you touch it, instead of putting volume up or low you already changed the song,maybe there is a new upgrade?", "These are the best headphones money can buy. Great fit, incredibly comfortable, and unbelievable sound quality. I use these all the time in college to drown out the noise from the class and productivity has gone up! Hands down, best headphones I have ever owned!!", "They are great, but even with my phone less than half a metre away I had regular cutouts over Bluetooth in my office environment. I have started to dislike the gesture controls too. Too easy to accidentally cause them to mess up. Great fit though and sound quality", "Not going to lie, \u00a3250 for these headphones are a bargain! I'd value these \u00a3400+ these are quick possibly the best thing I've ever bought! Amazing headphones, wear them literally everywhere but the gym, extremely comfortable. The music is so clear and detailed that your favourite songs will sound so much different and better.I'm in love, would rate it infinite stars if I could.", "The noise cancellation, which is why I bought these headphones, is just ridiculously good. What else can one add really, you put them on and you're like in your little bubble. No need to say that for a PhD student, it is just priceless.I wish the white colour version was \"whiter\" because this shade of light grey makes it look like one of these old medical devices you can find in hospitals. In the meantime, when the only negative criticism that I can think of is the colour of the product, it tells a lot on how amazing the actual product is.", "I have been a Bose fan for years but when the new Bose 700 came out they didn\u2019t appeal to me as I need the the headphones to go into a smaller size for travelling. The noise consolation is brilliant cuts out of mist of the aircraft noise also I like a louder vast and these were awesome", "These are brilliant. I had some no name headphones before that claimed to be noise cancelling but these are far far better. Sound quality is good too and the noise cancellt means you can have the volume down, which is good for you future tinitus-less hearing", "There is no doubt that I found the sound amazing and the noise-cancelling helpful. But I think the build quality is on a poor level. I first had an issue with the antenna inside come loose and had to send it to a Sony Repair Service, which they did fix. Then later after a couple of months, I started to notice the joints/hinge would just rub against each other every time I would move my head, making an unpleasant sound. To spend \u00a3263.97 for these is not worth it, returned it with the help of Amazon. Never buying anything that\u2019s related to Sony.", "Sound is brilliant, the noise cancelling is beyond belief. Extremely useful on trains and airplanes and I would not travel on an airplane without them.", "The noise cancellation is remarkable - on first wearing the headphones I was shocked to see myself tap the table and not hear anything, then type on a keyboard in silence. When a tractor drove past, with the window open, I heard nothing. Amazing. As for the sound quality when playing music, I am no expert, but my classical music sounds fantastic to me. I am rarely moved to write a review but these headphones have more than delivered, I am very impressed and now can't work in the office without them.", "You can believe it when it says noise cancellingThis is my second pair after previously owning the wh1000xm2.  These got water damaged and could not live without.Tried buying a cheaper pair (Sony and \u00a3200+) which claimed to be noise cancelling but pfft and sent back in favour of these.", "So I have detox beats, jabra t series, older model of Bose and then I spent 6 months researching for the best pair of wireless noise cancelling over heads and I saw these have such rave reviews. So I researched, tech radar, t3, every gadget site and YouTube review going. Then took the plunge \u00a3279, and I don\u2019t regret at ALLLLL. I\u2019ve worn these everyday for 12 hours for the last 3 months and they still amaze me. I\u2019ve missed trains or caught the wrong one at once once a week because I\u2019m lost in the music, the app is amazing also. These are incredible, not a regret in my body even at the cost", "As the headline states, these are imho perfect headphones.Fantastic audio quality, 30hrs run time and awesome noise cancellation. My pair of bluetooth audio technica headphones were great but the noise cancelling pushed these ahead. Well worth the money and imho better then the equivalent beats.", "Probably the best headphones I have ever used. I have used a Sennheiser Urbanite XL previously but it is nothing compared to this. The ANC works well when I commute in the bus. One feature I love about the app is the adaptive noise cancelling as it automatically detects if I'm walking or commuting or just resting and the level of noise cancellation will adapt to it. Overall, excellent headphone.", "I bought it before Christmas and I am amazed about the active noise cancelling on this pair of headphones. I travel quite a lot and I like to have quick naps or read on the plane. This sony headphones cancels around 90% of the engine noise spectrum of frequency so thats great.Also I work in a noisy office with plenty of people discussing about projects and stuff at the same time so it helps me to focus on my tasks.Very recommended!", "The best noise cancelling headphones I\u2019ve had by a mile. I\u2019ve had two pairs of AKG N60\u2019s, which were great, but these are a class apart. Exceptional noise cancelling, terrific sound quality, great battery life, comfortable. The only slight niggle is the touch control on the side of the headphone which takes some getting used to. But that\u2019s very minor. They sound awesome.", "These are amazing! I use them at the office because everyone tends to stand around me talking and distracting me from work. I need quietness to focus. These give me exactly that. They also are hands-free when you speak on the phone. The design is also so pretty. I'm really happy I got them. They're pricy, but worth it.", "Massive design flaw wherein the microphone focuses on background noise over your own voice, especially a problem when used in a somewhat noisy office (this issue is not had with cheaper headsets). After speaking to Sony support they have informed the microphone for calls is located at the back of the headset!?", "ConClumsy touch control on headphone.Otherwise fantastic sound, perfect mids and high, punchy base, sony connect software works best on android (s10) with dolby atmos, not used on iphones so refrain from commentsProCan suggest this over other competitors", "Only had em a few days but very impressed so far. I found after a while i forget ive got them on my head and get totally imersed in the music", "The best Headphones I have ever had I use them for at least 2 hours up to 4 hrs every day.Sound quality detailed and good vibrant base Just really nice very comfortable,battery is great and the quick charge is awesome if you have forgotten to charge up  Best in 49 years so far well done Sony superb job", "Bought as a gift for my son. They are brilliant. The sound quality is great, the storage box is also nice as it\u2019s hard so \u2018phones are safe in bags etc. The noise cancelling is so good it makes air travel in the noisy back seats completely bearable.", "These are the best headphones I have yet had. Clarity of sound is awesome and never seem to run out of battery. I listen to a mix music , from classical to rock, and all are well served by these excellent phones. Expensive, but worth the money.", "Not great sound quality but amazing noise cancelling, only downside is that it doesn't pause the music when you remove the headphones from ears as my previous cheaper headphones. Also volume control dose not intergrades with the phone or tablet so you end up adjusting volume on both phone and headphones.", "Awesome headphones, these work perfectly and cancel all the background noise out on the train!Good clear audio with decent bass and clear treble.I brought these for commuting, and general moments when I dint want to listen to the background waffle!Battery life is amazing and easy to use.", "These headphones are everything I was hoping for...and some more! Sound quality is excellent, they're supremely comfortable to wear and the noise cancelling is almost complete silence. Bluetooth works really well and there's a wired connection to my HiFi. I also like the neat carrying case...and the headphones look good too.", "Only piece of tech I have ever had to return on day one...The pairing button (which also resets the device, genuis!) is suspectible to not working, so you're left with a bluetooth audio device you can neither use nor fix!You can power off and on endlessly, so if thats all you want I fully recommend!It says a lot when AirPods outperform these cans!Seriously though, go to Audio-Teknika - or anywhere else, really!", "I bought these headphones almost three months ago and, so far, the experience was just brilliant. The sound quality is great, they do the ANC very well for consistent noises such as a plane or bus engine, but, of course, does not work very well when people are speaking (you can increase the music volume instead). They are very sturdy, well-built, and have a very beautiful minimalistic design. I use them for work on average 8-10 hours per day, so a single charge lasts me approx. 3 working days.", "These headphones impress in all the areas in which it is important that they should impress: sound, design, comfort, battery life, even the related app is good with useful features (as well as some that aren't).  My only quibbles with them are that after a while they get a bit sweaty to wear and they're not exciting to look at", "The delivery stressed me out, but overall I'm very satisfied with this product! Sound is amazing, I can't stop shaking my head by the music. Noise cancellation is impressive, pretty handy. Also, the control usage is good too. U don't need to press any button, just swipe. The case is neat, I thought it will be bigger, but it's an appropriate size for traveling, I like it. :)", "Having read some many good reviews about this heaphones I decided to take the plunge and I am not dissapointed. Both the sound and the noise cancelling are far better than the bose qc 35 ii (which i owned previously).Extreamely happy with this headphones and I highly recommend them.", "Best wireless headphones in the market right now period.. sound quality and noise cancelling are just phenomenal. A nice improvement over the xm2s as well. Lighter, more comfortable over longer periods. And a few hours extra battery life which is always a bonus. I'd recommend you download the headphone connect app as well for eq and sound effects and of coarse always try and use LDAC for best sound quality \ud83e\udd17", "Absolutely incredible 5he controls on the headset take a few goes to get used to but once you are it's like second nature the sound is amazing I heard drums on a song that I'd never heard before bass is crisp and not raspy vocals sound like they are in the room was hesitant because of the price tag but they have justified it for me I did a bit of research before buying and these were the ones at the top of all the lists and now I see why", "Use them walking to and from work which includes busy roads and I hear no traffic noise. Sound quality is incredible bass is not overpowering like Dre beats. App allows you to choose your preferred equaliser which you can also customise. Very comfortable but do get a little sweaty even on a brisk 10-15 minute walk.", "The noise cancellation is really good, sound quality is as expected for headphones this expensive, and I haven\u2019t had any issues with the Bluetooth like I often do. The swipe controls are really convenient (aside from very occasionally doing them by accident). The only downside so far has been comfort when wearing them for a long time \u2013 physically, they\u2019re very comfortable, but the noise cancellation definitely wears out my ears a bit. I think this is pretty unavoidable though, and don\u2019t think any of the other brands do much better on it.", "Excellent product. Sound  quality is exceptional.I bought the WF-1000XM3 thinking the sound would be similar but i was disappointed with the noise cancelling so i ask for an exchange and now i finally have the amazing WH-1000XM3. Happy days!", "Sound cancellation is superb. Sound quality is amazing and the ability to feed in ambient noise  is great  when you need it. They feel light and very comfortable and the carry case is of high quality.  ...only gripe is that your ears cannot ventilate in hot weather , so they can start to feel sweaty if worn for long periods in warm weather.", "Purchasing a \u00a3300+ pair of headphones was not a snap decision but I am very glad I eventually did... These a simply superb and my travelling, office and bedroom music and streaming audio experience has been transformed!  I can only say that if you want the very best headphone listening experience then look no further.", "They have the best audio I have ever heard, the are far greater than any other headphones I have ever used,  the Bluetooth is Amazing along with the fact that the ANC is better than their obvious biggest competitors, the battery lasts me weeks and charges in about 15-20mins;I would highly recommend this purchase due to the fact that they far exceed the quality of all others at this price point", "I was excited this afternoon to receive these headphones, but was truly disappointed to open the box and find a candle inside instead. The most expensive candle I have ever bought!I'm not sure if this was your fault but, you really need to work this out.", "Amazing noise cancelling... but it gave me terrible headaches and nausea after approximately 10min.A shame as all the rest was very good. Returned to Amazon as I cannot use NC and this is an expensive piece of kit.Please aware that NC makes so people sick, it is not that uncommon...", "Great headphones, solid noise cancellation and sound.Bluetooth sync is pretty good, but wired connections sometimes make  an annoying buzzing noise in the right ear.The ear cushion does not work well with glasses (annoying squeaking sound as it rubs together)Sometimes cold weather will activate the shortcut swipes on the right ear", "The sound is I\u2019ll say better than Bose qc2 however very close is a more powerful sound as Bose is slightly clearer . The app is good although after a while you don\u2019t bother and very comfortable a tiny bit heavier than Bose but you get use to overall I\u2019m very happy with these headphone", "I have nearly been run over about 4 times and have also banged my head and cut my shin twice. Flocci non faccio. I love the noise cancelled world. But, be weary. You may not want to leave it.  This is my first pair. They really are a sensation. The mic doesn't work well in transit but I don't think they were designed for that. Treat yourself. Disappear.", "In love with Sony Headphones\ud83d\ude0d it cancel noise as you put it on with nothing playing. It makes you cut off with surrounding wherever you are, just relax and enjoy your time. The touch sensor is amazing feature. Thanks Sony\ud83d\udc4d", "Absolutely brilliant. Have used in both plane and train rides. Makes such a difference as most of the noise is cancelled out. With music playing, it can down out most of the other noises. An absolute must for travellers.", "best pair of nc headphones Ive owned but they are not perfect I wear mines on the smallest setting and my commute to work consists of 1hr on a bumpy bus then a further hr on a tram. I\u2019ve found that the way the headband attaches to the cup they rattle on the bumpy bus ride.  Amazon are sending me a 2nd pair to see if it continues which I am sure it will.", "I was amazed when I put it on first time seems like I was  totally disconnected from outside world. Such awesome noise cancellation Sony has. It looks premium and have a very lasting battery backup. Only thing I didn't like that its not a multi point connection. Every time you want to switch to other device, you have to connect it manually.", "I bought these headphones because I was suffering from a horrible noise nuisance due to demolition works near my home (non stop banging all day). They were a perfect relief I can now block the noise and keep on working from home without getting crazy and keeping my sanity intact. The sound of music is great, they are very comfortable to wear even for long hours. Definitely worth the price !", "Love them, noise cancelling is fantastic.", "I bought these because i travel, they are fantastic for the noise cancelling, i also use them for playing console gaming they even work with the xbox elite controller. My girl friend has the bose and she thinks these are great.", "The noise cancelling on these is first class.The touch controls for volume, play/pause, and skipping tracks are very fiddly, but i suppose it's better than nothing.", "The sound quality and noise cancelling features with this item are top quality. They are the most comfortable headphones you can buy and you will be able to wear them for hours in comfort, noise cancelling and other features work very well.Overall an excellent  product.", "The touch interface takes a while to get used to, but the noise cancellation is second to none. My job sees me working in a data centre - the ability to hear (and be heard in ) a phonecall over Bluetooth is invaluable.", "Bought this headphones a month back. Pros- 1. Excellent voice quality 2. Good noise cancellation  3. Comfortable on ears 4. Best battery life  Cons- 1. Sometimes the buttons are difficult operate 2. Ears touch inside of the headphones", "the noise cancelling on this headphone is phenomenal! once I wear it, I can barely hear myself. It is very comfortable and lightweight. I always use ambience mode when I'm walking around because if not, I can't even hear the sound of the cars.", "I bought a phone capable of LDAC over Bluetooth as the iPhone defaults to AAC codec. I was really enjoying Sony's headphone app eq settings with the iphone, but once I used the Sony eq on my new phone, Bluetooth defaults to SBC which is the lowest quality.I wonder if Sony will change this one day ? Also when the headphones are wired the app doesn't work at all as it relies on the Bluetooth connection. These are just a couple of niggles as the overall sound and quality of the headphones are amazing.", "Can't fault them, noise cancelling drowns out the office chatter and the ability to quickly listen in on a conversation without even taking them off is so handy. Perfectly comfortable for all day wear too.", "These are by far the best earphones I've ever heard and now have the pleasure of owning.I work in a shared office and I can now listen to my music much quieter as the noise cancellation drowns out the background chatter. Also I've realised how loud the air conditioning is in my office, it's weird, you only hear it when you take the headphones off and it's deafening!", "The best headphones ever, cut out so much noise and the sound quality is immense. The app is great and you can adjust the sound controls to suit your taste. The only annoying things are random sound controls that activate when you touch the headphones in certain ways, and the google assistant (which I want to turn off but can\u2019t work out how) randomly starts to call people from my phone book and it\u2019s difficult to stop. Other than that though, they\u2019re fantastic.", "Bought as a replacement for Bose QC 35s that my son had taken away, Noise cancellation isn't as good and can only link to one device at a time - a nuisnace when travelling and switching between phone and tablet.  Also more expensive than the Bose.", "Good noise cancellation. Average sound. EQ is very limited. It's loud but that's not important if the sound is not excellent. Massively geared towards bass levels. Overpowers the trebles too much for me.", "Amazing headphones. I had the Bose qc 25s before these. Decided to go Sony for a change.The noise cancelling is amazing as is the sound. The Bose have better overall sound but the Sonys are better for things with deeper bass.Two negatives: You can only connect the headphones to one device at a time.The headphones can hurt the top of your head after about an hour and your ears get warm, this doesn't happen with the Bose.They're amazing headphones though", "Whilst the noise cancellation is ok, it isn\u2019t perfect but as I didn\u2019t buy them for that I\u2019m not bothered. The quality of audio is fantastic, they are light and comfortable and battery life is outstanding.", "I have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I like it. I bought it mainly for noise canceling purposes. The noise canceling is not complete, because you can still hear some noise (hi-pitch calls from my 10yo, the beeping sound of the office printer), but it does the job well enough as sounds seem to be far away. Cancels bass surrounding sounds well.Very soft touch and quite ergonomic. Super comfortable. Quality material.", "Absolutely amazing. Noise cancellation is impressive. Sound is impressive.So good that i bought an additional pair as a present for my brother.Although i wasn't impressed with the delivery - the driver did not deliver the original pair (even though he was apparently 2 stops away when my tracker said it has been delivered and signed for) and i had to contact customer service to send a replacement (which worked out fine in the end).", "Everything is great about these headphones. But having been through 3 replacement pairs from different batches, They create LOUD creaking noises while placing them on your head.Avoid until Sony decides to make their build quality better.", "Used mainly for travel. On a plane it almost completely eliminated the droning allowing you to rest/sleep/ listen/watch. Quite amazing technology. Pretty comfortable as it fits over the ears. Very good", "Still have to get used to the volume control but boy the sound is amazing. The bass is impressive and the clarity is sublime.  Told a colleague who bought the silver one, regret not going for silver.", "Best headphones I've ever owned,great sound quality and the NC is top notch", "I thought about getting these for ages but dithered because of the price. In the end decide to just treat myself and SO glad I did! These headphones have transformed my commute! They\u2019re brilliant, they really do cut out most background noise and more comfortable than any others I\u2019ve tried, I love them!", "Why is the supplied charging cable so incredibly short? At 20 cm it makes it completely impractical to use. For the price of these headphones you would at least expect a cable of sensible length. Otherwise would have given 5 stars with no hesitation.Other than that, delighted with them and would highly recommend!", "The parcel came in pretty fast, but with WRONG items! No headphones, but a pair of earplugs with UNKNOWN manufacturer and a bunch of things that are irrelevant to the order. Pity!", "These things are awesome, sound quality is amazing, noise cancelling is terrific, can't hear the kids moaning or asking for money only down side is can't hear being called for tea when it's not my turn to cook.", "Headline says it all, better sound quality and better noise cancelling than the QC35 that i own.", "Once you understand how they work, these are an excellent pair of headphones. People seem to be bring caught out by the headphones automatically turning off the noise cancellation if you begin walking. It is a handy safety feature if you are near a road.  I love mine, I use them at home if the neighbours are being noisy, on aircraft (obv) and if I need to concentrate at work. All round excellent headphones.", "Absolutely love these headphones. The app for mobile devices is very good and has various features to improve the experience. The sound quality is great and noise cancellation is like nothing I\u2019ve experienced before.Recently used them on a long haul flight from UK to Australia - so comfortable I forgot I had them on, could hear everything clearly and literally no sound from the planes loud engines.Would definitely recommend these!", "Excellent sound, good comfort for multiple hours of wear and excellent battery life. The swipe motions are kinda pointless at least for me but the sound quality is so good easily blows away the competition.Only problem is that in cold or windy weather my headphones stop playing music sometimes. It can be quite frustrating as you have to reach back and forth to turn your music on again but it does not happen often nor does it stop me from fully recommending the product.", "I don\u2019t give out five stars easily .! These headphones are the best I  owned by far .! And I owned lots of top quality headphones.! Just ask all my family and friends .! I pass them on after a while .! But this one is a keeper .!", "Brand new but dirty inside. It came with no battery charged. Wrong first impression, but after 3 hours charging, all good. This set is what I was looking for. Just missing the Amazon email with the link to the 90 days of Amazon music unlimited trial", "I have tried several types over the years, these are the best I have come across. Suggest you try them first as they do need to completely cove the ears to work so dependant on your head/ear shape", "What can you say? These are the perfect heapdhones.I upgraded from my previous wh1000 xm2 and these are more comfortable and better at sound cancellation.All previous issues with xm2 are fixed with xm3. 5 stars.", "I'll never buy a SONY product again in my life. They give just 1 year of warranty on this product.. and of course they didn't  accepted to repair my headphones because I asked for assistance a few days after the end of warranty.....SO DISAPPOINTED!!!", "Just horrendous. \u00a3400 for these headphones is a daylight robbery. The only way I can describe the sound quality is with this emoji \ud83e\udd2eThe price tag on these considering how low the sound quality is, is just bonkers. I used to have the B&amp;o H4 which cost less, but the sound quality was much much much better. No low deep bass but the sound was crystal clear. These headphones? My grandma's twitters from the 70s put these joke of a headphones to shame. Just do not buy them. You will be disappointed", "I like this headset,  but is a nightmare to listen  music on underground.  I think is from different  pressure . I tried  to setup  on underground,  but it still on 1 Atm. I feel  like somebody  use a vacuum  pump in your ears.Also, I don't  like when noise cancellation  is change. Why  stop the music?", "Nothing to dislike. Previously had a set of SONY In-Ear Noise Reducing earphones but these are so much better, comfortable, so effective in screening out noise, can be tailored to suit your own tastes via the App. Great buy.", "Best set of headphones I've ever had and the noise cancelling is quite brilliant.  Even with the TV on full blast (my partner is hard of hearing) you can listen comfortably to the quietest passages of music.  Top marks.", "A great product: comfy, great sound and quick to connect. Also, assume to use for hands free calling", "Amazing headphones, but lost faith as 1 side started shaking and bass was not as good after a few weeks use.", "Great product!!! On the day I received it in the office, other two colleagues ordered it straight away.Great sound, great noise cancelling technology and can be adjusted through the app to the environment.Not perfect with the phone calls when outside though, but i don't talk much on the phone so no don't really mind.", "Admittedly these are my first noise cancelling headphones but i absolutely love them. The sound quality is excellent and the adaptive noise cancelling is very clever, although its a bit annoying that it stops the music you are listening to as it switches mode. That really is my only complaint so far though. Very nice product!", "So happy with my Sony headphones. Read all the reviews about these being the best noise cancelling headphones and I have to agree. I love my bass and these give it to me in abundance. The buying experience was fuss free with the item arriving on time, completely sealed and in top quality condition. I\u2019m a very happy customer.", "I have used Bose noise cancelling headphones for the past 10 years or so.  I just bought the Sony and am thrilled with it.  Particularly the sound control via the App is brilliant.  The only criticism I have is that the controls on the right earphone can be easily triggered when trying to adjust the headphones!

Except the bus driver, he is alright.", "I bought these headphones based on the many buyer reviews and was not disappointed. Very comfortable and excellent noise cancelling abilities. Sound was excellent. Definitely recommend", "Overall great noise cancelling and comfort. The design is slick and connection straight forward.The controls being touch can be cumbersome at times but you get the skill relatively quickly.Main downside is the microphone for receiving calls is very poor. People complained that it sounded like I was in a tunnel. I tend not to use these for calling purposes so limited impact for me but is a key drawback.", "Never wrong with Song, only charged once, and it has been over a week, I still using it. As we all know Sony knows the sound. I was comparing Sony and Bosch, I am glad I did not right choice.", "Truly a great Headphone! Tested on a 10hr flight and I barely heard the plane engine, I use them on the Tube same thing. Money well spent.", "Outstanding. The reviews are right. Whether on planes, trains, rubes, buses, walking aling the street, noise cancelling is excellent, sound quality superb. Making calls not so much.", "The headphones sound good, but the touch controls can be triggered accidentally. This seems most noticeable on cold mornings, when the headphones will skip tracks and randomly activate Siri on my phone.", "Don\u2019t waste your money on cheaper alternatives. Excellent comfort and noise-cancelling performance, and battery life is amazing. Wish I had waited for Black Friday pricing, however!", "Very happy with these headphones.

I never had this issue with less expensive headset. I will return it.", "Wow the headphones are truly the best headphones I've ever purchased. The base is amazing and the high and lows are on point. You can download the app for a full customizable feel and boy is it worth it. The build quality is solid and durable and comfortable for long time use. I'm being honest here as I've spent a lot of money on these. You will not be disappointed in the slightest.", "good. really nice bit of audio kit. a tad too bass emphasised out of the box, but easy to rectify with the equaliser. a bit too plastic,  but fold well and are light weight..", "Out of the box just superb, absolutely superb. These rival many a wired set of cans costing 2 or even 3 times this amount. What Sony have achieved here is pure sorcery.", "Sound quality and noise cancelling are truly excellent.  Easy to set up and use.  The touchpad on the right speaker works really well, and I find it intuitive.  Having used the Headphones, I find the absence of a wire to be soooo liberating, and make these cans a fantastic buy.Don't hesitate!", "Great sound, noise cancellation works well and they work with iPhone X and Panasonic TV. I find them comfortable and they look good.

The noise cancelling is good and so is the sound.  Bluetooth is good way better than my bose qc35. They are also still going after nearly 6 months which I couldnt say for the bose.UPDATE Have had issues with the headphones contacted Amazon who were no help, apart from passing me to Sony.  Sony are so far useless, don't seem to listen, care or understand.  Keep saying they will get back to me, however when they do it is of no help and the process starts over.", "Very good headset, baterrylife is extreamly good, last 4 days with 8hs a day. Volume control is super hard to get used to, but tolarablem. Noise vanceling is also very good.", "I have Bose QC35, QC35\u2161\uff0cand this Sony one. The sound quality of Sony is the best. QC35\u2161 is the most comfortable one. As for the noise-cancelling function, I think QC35\u2161 and this Sony one is almost the same. So if you prefer better sound quality, choose this one!", "Outstanding noise cancellation, wonderful sound quality, good battery life, light. What else would you want from headphones?", "Best money can buy.After shopping around and buying a few other headphones, beats, b&amp;o and more I decided to go for a pair of Sonys.At first volume wasn\u2019t what I was expecting it wasn\u2019t loud, after a few days of use the volume got better and you can hear stuff that you\u2019ve not heard in songs before.If you\u2019re thinking about purchasing do it.", "Love everything about these headphones aside from the fact that my ear touches the inner foam. This takes some getting used to and would be the perfect headphones if they didn\u2019t.

This headphone shouldn't be noise cancellation as if you walk and you move your head. U will get bad sound quality.Ambient mode. It will disable noise cancellation and sound quality drops.", "With the exception of the creaking I struggle to fault these headphones. Shame they're made of fairly cheap plastic that you can hear creaking when you pull them apart (or even just chew with them on).Sound quality is excellent, as is noise cancellation", "Great battery life .Easy to set up.Can be used a local sound amplifier .A little heavy , but comfortable.ONly downside is the blue flashing LED when on - can be annoying in low light conditions such as night travel ( on planes etc )", "I love these headphones. I work in music and these are my headphones of choice. The noise cancellation is excellent and the sound quality is brilliant.The over ear design is comfortable for long wear sessions. Other songwriters and producers I know also choose these.", "If you buy a headphones over \u00a3250 like this Sony and compare it with a headphone that only costs \u00a317, there is a huge difference. The more expensive one has a brilliant sound quality, which cuts out outside noise and also has a lead to connect to the i-pod or laptop. It also has bluetooth that connect to devices without any wires. Well worth getting if you want brilliant sound quality.", "I am blown away! Using amazon HD music with these headphones and my one plus 6T. I am in ecstacy, pure enjoyment. Got them as a Christmas present, easy to set up and the quality of music (with the right source) is like listening to music for the first time. Obviously there is tidal as well as others but you need HD, or other high quality source to really appreciate how great these are.", "Just superb sound quality, isolation and comfort.  Can barely feel them on my (large) head because they are lightweight and the materials are excellent.  There is a tiny amount of bleed, so if you want to dial it up loud and coworkers are close by it could be an issue.  Otherwise I think these are the best things I've bought in a long time.", "These are brilliant. Sound quality is great and noise cancelling is AMAZING!!!!!!!They are expensive but what you get for the price is a product of the highest quality.Highly recommended.", "I had a Bose noise cancelling (with wire) before and loved it. I found this Sony product better. Noise cancelling is sensentaional and it has a cool function of switching on and off the noise cancelling very easily.", "I bought these for a birthday present for my son, no complaints and he wears them constantly. I\u2019ve listened to them as well and sound is amazing, great quality!", "Wow! ANC blew Bose QC35II out of the room. Seriously top quality.

PS volume control works to an extent ( nothing to over worry about unless you was 3.5% up or down coz you get 4 or 2)", "The best out there. Excellent battery life, comfort, and noise cancellation. Well balanced and vibrant sound that will suit most users. For the audiophiles, buy it for the most noise cancellation and comfort, but adjust the equaliser to get better mids (for music only). For movies, the sound is perfect and theatrical.", "The one slight downside is that it won\u2019t pair with two devices at once. So if you need to switch between mobile and iPad it\u2019s a bit fiddly when in a plane. However it is a small niggle and only takes a few seconds.", "I am returning this item for a replacement. Everything is perfect except for the crackling in the right ear cup when the noise cancelling is on.", "Are you serious? I spent \u00a3250 on a set of headphones, and you can't listen to music while charging? This is a huge step backward from non-wireless headphones, just a pathetic effort from Sony.You can still plug in an aux jack while on charge, but the noise cancelling still won't come on, and the quality of aux audio is poor when the headphones aren't switched on.When they aren't on charge they're great", "The sound quality is simply the best.I don't like that in the wind the sound is distorced... But over all I really love it.I prefer instead of touch phisical butons, but it is not an issue.Buy it and you will not regret!", "They sound good. They have brilliant noise cancelling even while not playing anything and I found myself often putting them on without music just to relax. The app is essential however.", "I am not great at doing product reviews, but these headphones are exceptional... I have already owned some really good headphones but these are by some  way the best... excellent in every way", "Didn't believe the stated 30hour battery life, but it's true. Does 30 hours easy and sounds incredible. Little bass heavy so turned the bass down a smidgeon. Noise canceling is unreal. Also impressive is how little sound leak there is, even when on full blast. Only complaint is they can get warm and uncomfortable when used for long durations.", "I\u2019d like for the headphones to not always go straight into noise cancelling mode from power on and remember its last sound setting state. Its a little niggle and tbh there might be a setting somewhere for it. I haven\u2019t figured it out otherwise great bit of kit. It can hold a charge all week for me and its quick to charge too which helps as I can leave it charging over a lunch break fir uninterrupted listening in the office.", "Exceptional.  Compared to Bose much better sound quality, slightly more comfy, maybe very slightly less noise cancelling.  For me sound quality is No 1 so Sony wins by a margin.", "The noise cancelling on these are absolutely superb. I travel on planes, trains and the tube often and yet these help me get to the other end feeling far better than if I was subjected to the normal noise you get on those modes of transport.

Extremely pleased I chose to use this company. Everything is as described. Fantastic", "I've been really impressed with these. I work in an open plan office so as well as ambient noise from things like air-con there's also a lot of talking going on around me. Even when not playing any music it really cuts the noise right down and I can play music at a nice gentle volume to go off into a world of my own. I really like the touch gesture controls too, although you might look a little odd to other people.", "Sometimes glitches a bit when I\u2019m using it. Stutters when my WiFi is cut off, sometimes turns off on its own (rarely but has happened before). Sound is so balanced that sometimes the higher registers are barely audible. Noise cancelling filters out voice and wind but loud sounds are still audible. Overall an excellent product. Battery life doesn\u2019t last as long as advertised, but still gives me about 10 or so hours.", "These headphones work as advertised and really do reduce noise. Sound quality is excellent and battery life has not been tested to the limits but is certainly adequate.", "Very good quality headphones - reflecting the price.

It was delivered really quickly, which I would expect with Amazon Prime", "Absolutely delighted. Bought these after loosong one of my sony earphones. The sound quality is incredible and much better when compared with the earphones", "Best wireless headphones ever! I had the XM2 and bought these due to the lighter weight. NC seems to be on par for both XM2 and XM3.", "What's not to like about these phones pairs easily with most of my devices (yet to pair with my tv) and noise cancelling/sound quality is superb. Can't speak highly enough about battery life, full charge gives 30 hours insane. Bose owner previously.", "Overall very pleased with  the headphones, but I was disappointed to find that the volume control on the headphones does not work when they are connected by a wire - it only works on a bluetooth connection. I know that there are other models on the market where it works on both!", "Wasn't sure what headphones to buy went for these because have used sony for year and no complaints but these Headphones take it to the next level", "Easily the best headphones I\u2019ve owned. So light and the sound quality is second to none.", "Amazing headphones. Best I've ever owned. But shame on Amazon for offering a case as an additional purchase as these headphones come with a SONY case designed for the headphones that also stores the power cable and plug / cables for use when flying. YOU DON'T NEED ANOTHER CASE. You'll just have to sort out sending it back!!!", "Excellent all-round just as all online reviews stated. I travel long distances in trains, buses and airplanes for work all the time and do not know how I was getting around before these; the noise cancellation and extreme comfort is a life saver.

Comfortable to wear great sound and noise cancellation allows listening to music in noisy environment like never before.", "Used with my PC via bluetooth and sound quality was really dissapointing with poor resolution.  Returned them and got some denon 5200 wired cans instead.", "The noise cancelling is very disappointing, my akg n700 dose a better job. Also the pair I received was just basting white noise when NC was on. I heared a lot of people praising these headphones, but they are just as bad as the rest.", "I use headphones religiously, and these last easily up to 26 hours approx, have amazing sound quality and bass and I hardly feel them on my head. I go from wha I used to enjoy to the Sony's and it's world's apart.", "Absolutely awsome pair of headphones.

Great battery life, quality design and construction. The noose cancellation is not perfect and the headphones sound a loud \u2018dong\u2019 (Unnecessary) when adjusting for pressure/ambient sound changes for NC.The side controls are a neat idea, but do not work every time and are rather fiddly.Overall a great pair of headphones though and better than the Bose QC\u2019s", "As a massive audiophile, these headphones are the best on the market in their price range.Slightly gritty at high volumes but a play with the equaliser levels sorted that right out. Perfect noise cancelling and the hands free features are excellent. There is also a very handy mute feature to mute your music and noise cancelling so you can interact with people without having to remove the headphones.", "Quite good pair of noise cancelling overear headphones. Light, nice design, overall good quality. Really like them. Quick to charge.", "They are brilliant but you can still hear cars if you are out on the street with noise cancelling, I would put it that for my assumption that itd be like 90% noise cancelling, other than that they are brilliant, use them mostly going to and from work, which is a half hour door to door and took 6 weeks till I had to charge them.", "These are amazing at noise cacellation. I work in a busy noisy office, and these headphones drown out the office noise superbly. Worth the price.", "Brilliant sound quality, reliable connection and great build quality.

Very immersive sound. Comfy etc. Only draw back is the cost, as you don\u2019t really want to sweat in gym with them on or get caught in heavy rain as you don\u2019t want to wreck such an expensive item. But these are amazing for the commute or any kind of travel", "It\u2019s impossible to convey in words the noise cancelling effect on these headphones paired with a great sound and comfort. Amazing.", "Absolutely amazing. Cannot hear the noisy neighbour blasting his music out during the day. Definite life savers. Build quality is very good, battery life is around 20 hours. Only downside is the app but the latest update seems to have fixed things.", "Has nobody noticed that, with noise cancelling on, these headphones cut the first fraction of a second of each track off? If you are listening to chamber or orchestral music, this is not really tolerable. All the complementary comments of the other reviews apply once you are past the initial burp but surly Sony have enough technical skill to handle start up transients?", "Bought these to replace Bowers PX, they are fabulous, more comfortable than PX and sound amazing.

I recommend these.", "Just the best pair of headphones out thereNo question. Better than Bose, senheiser and all of those. Only thing to improve would be water resistance", "It took me a while to decide between them and the Bose. Noise cancellation was the most important feature I was seeking for, I tried them both and the Sonys performed slightly better. Anyway the part where they truly won is sound quality, which is excellent.", "I had the very first version but they've been stolen from rental car so bought the mark3. They are even better than the old ones. Bose is just for those who has to have Bose no matter how bad they are.", "When I got these headphones, I was BLOWN AWAY. Incredible noise cancelling and sound quality to match. Fast Forward a few short months, and the noise cancelling is horrid. I dont know what Sony did but I went from not being able to hear my girlfriend sat across from me to hearing my fingers tapping the table. For the price I am incredibly disappointed and will be seeking a refund or fix from Amazon.", "Love these headphones, can't hear anything but my music when I'm outside/in the tube, is the best thing.

Comfy and lightweight! Quality everywhere. Sound is pure. Expensive but worth every penny. One of my best purchases.", "Battery life is a bit on the lower side. Noise cancellation takes a time (in few seconds) to detect high noises (underground train). Sometimes works great sometimes not so good. Probably should have opted for Bose for better noise cancellation", "Have been using it for a few months and I really like it but there are a few minor things that annoy me, the first being the play/pause button. Like why was it designed like that? It doesn't even work well plus you have to align your finger well. The second being that the ambient sound mode doesn't work with loud music, this is a minor issue but still something I would like to see done better.", "Cuts out almost everything around you so great for use on the underground or listening to music in noisy placesBattery life incredible, comfortable and good one finger control for all operation requirementsInstant Bluetooth connectivity each time", "Does what it says.

I'd definitely go for something cheaper next time.", "Excellent headphones, very comfortable on the ear, even for long periods. I have B&amp;O and Bose in ear and there are every bit as good.

Intuitive controls once you have gone through the companion app and set it how you like. Best pair of headphones in this price range.", "Very happy with the product, I previously had Dr Dre's but after two pairs breaking on me after a couple of years of use I decided to change brand.

These replaced my Bose Quiet Comfort's that I had for a few years, the Sony's are in a different league.

After the extensive reviews i was expecting the Sony to knock out the Bose but quite the opposite happened.Music quality: found the Sony far too bass heavy. I used the app to boost the treble but it still sounded muddy against the clarity of the Bose.Noise cancellation: excellent but I'd be hard pressed to notice a difference from the Bose on my daily bus/train/city walking commute. Can't comment on plane, etc. I understand the Sony's excel here.Comfort and quality: I'd give this to the Sony. Although plastic, it did feel a good quality item with excellent ergonomics. Definitely feels more premium than the Bose, including the accessories. The padding is excellent. Although slimmer than the XM2 these XM3s still provide a wider profile on the head than the Boses though.Voice calling: Really not good. People I spoke to on the phone really struggled to hear me. I use these to make calls in my flat predominantly, without any background noise. This was the biggest disappointed for such premium phones; t'was really appalling.Extras: the app really is excellent and allows a lot more customisation than the Bose. Unfortunately whatever settings I chose did not improve the sound over the Bose, nor remedy the calling issue.I really wanted these over the Bose but was completely underwhelmed.

Then just like the previous two generation models problems with right side hinge &amp; ear cup creaking after 72 hours. I read many forums &amp; reviews about this problem I thought what were the chances of this happening to me not long to be honest.Because I liked them so much I decided to send them to Sonys repair centre to be fixed. Three weeks later they replied &amp; said they can\u2019t fix the issue because they don\u2019t have the parts &amp; could not exchange because they were sold out everwhere.

The headphones are unlistenable for classical or jazz unless you are prepared to EQ. The bass is incredibly boomy and overwhelmes everything, some reviews have measured the extra bass at up to +5db (!)  The treble is also rather dark.  Sony claim that the exagerated bass can be adjusted once for all sources using their app, but not if you want the new LDAC profile, which is supposed to be a major selling point of the headphones, or use them in wired mode. The only way to fix the bass is to adjust the EQ for any source you plug them into, which is not always possible.  The noise cancelling is however very good.", "ARE iPHONE, iPAD &amp; iPOD USERS AWARE?Using my iPhone 7 + Oppo HA-2 DAC/amp + Shure SE535 earphones I have enjoyed superb sound quality (SQ). I was expecting to achieve much of that SQ with my nice new Sony WH-1000MX3 headphones (MX3s) but the drop in SQ came as a shock. They don\u2019t actually sound \u2018bad\u2019 but the combination of MX3s and iPhone 7 is underwhelming and not what I just spent \u00a3300 to hear. It was obvious that something was amiss. Where had my superb SQ gone?Some of the problem, I now understand, is that iPhones, iPads &amp; iPods default to \u2018AAC Bluetooth\u2019 for all Apple file formats. If you are playing the better quality lossless ALAC files, the iPhone dumbs that down to AAC standard before sending it by \u2018AAC Bluetooth\u2019 to the headphones. You therefore suffer an immediate loss of quality. Lossless ALAC files lose more than 50% of the data which provides the low level musical subtleties like string and vocal texture, room acoustics etc. That subtlety gets dismissed as \u2018noise\u2019. If you are happy to accept that, there is no point in you reading any further.ULTIMATE SOUND QUALITY?To keep things in proportion, the MX3s sound very good but they are nowhere near the SQ of the best sounding headphones. Good passive headphones costing well under \u00a3100 can make the MX3s sound relatively poor. There are reasons for this and none are a criticism of Sony.1. Closed-back headphones \u2018never\u2019 sound as good as open-back.2. Bluetooth is a compromised, lossy, compressed radio transmission system. Basic \u2018SBC Bluetooth\u2019 is only adequate for low bit-rate MP3, iPhone\u2019s \u2018AAC Bluetooth\u2019 is slightly better and OK for lossy AAC, Qualcomm \u2018aptX Bluetooth\u2019 and \u2018aptX HD Bluetooth\u2019 are a bit better and Sony\u2019s \u2018LDAC Bluetooth\u2019 is better still.3. For wireless use, the DAC and the amplifier are the ones built-in to the headphones. If you use an external WIRED phone or DAP, it is possible to use the better quality external DAC &amp; amp \u2013 so it can sound better. A good external amp will be far more powerful and the main advantage of power is better driver control, not volume.4. Top audio quality headphones cost a lot more that these do, just for passive headphones. That\u2019s before you start thinking about the electronics and R&amp;D \u2013 so be realistic!All things considered, Sony have their work cut out making these sound good. They have succeeded surprisingly well.WHAT MUSIC SOURCE?If you use compressed music such as Spotify, MP3 or AAC etc, you are probably not particularly interested in SQ or perhaps you don\u2019t know what you are missing. In that case, the MX3s will be absolutely fine however you use them, so just buy them. You still won\u2019t know what you are missing though, so I have added a few comments below on how to get better sound. You must of course start with a decent lossless music file, most commonly FLAC or ALAC. Your current ALAC, WAV or AIFF files are easy to convert free to FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) but you cannot improve an already compressed MP3, Ogg,  AAC, etc file. If you already use compressed files, you are rather stuck. Just try to convince yourself that they sound good enough. If you only use mediocre equipment, you may not be able to tell the difference.NOISE CANCELLING?This is staggeringly good. Quite amazing, wonderful and worth buying just for that alone! My wife has the earlier MX2 version, which are very good but these are significantly better. When used on \u2018silent\u2019 I can JUST about hear the TV at normal listening volume. Play some music and virtually nothing gets through. Just what I want on a long journey.Unfortunately, a significant SQ drop comes with the excellent noise cancelling. If you switch from full \u2018Noise cancelling\u2019 to \u2018Ambient sound\u2019 the SQ improves a little. If you switch to \u2018Ambient Sound Control Off\u2019 the SQ improves even more and is then pretty good for closed-back headphones. Good enough that it wouldn\u2019t concern me much BUT that is with noise cancelling off \u2013 bummer! All is not lost. If you start with the best SQ possible, it still gets degraded by the noise cancelling but it ends up at a more acceptable compromise level. The benefit of the noise cancelling is so high that it is well worth the compromise when in noisy environments.COMFORT?They are OK but I wish the size had not been compromised. My fairly normal, man-size ears touch the inside of the ear-cups and my ears get hot. The MX3s are nice and light but the comfort really isn\u2019t on a par with \u2018good\u2019 headphones. The Beyerdynamic professional range, just as one example, really do provide \u2018all-day\u2019 comfort for the working professional. Better comfort and much better sound quality for little over \u00a3100 \u2013 but no noise cancelling, so useless on a journey.Leaning back, the head-rest/back-rest sometimes pushes the MX3s forward uncomfortably but that may be a function of my head and ears. Life is full of compromises and this is one. Noise blocking IEMs are also a compromise but I will now opt for the MX3s.USE THEM WITH?I only use lossless codecs, ALAC or FLAC. Some are hi-res but mostly 44.1/16 (CD standard). A good recording at that standard has timbre, subtlety and nuances that get discarded as \u2018noise\u2019 by the lossy codecs.Whilst the full Bluetooth technicalities are beyond me. I will attempt to explain what I am hearing and a little of my understanding. If I mis-describe the technology \u2013 I apologise.You will commonly see the Bluetooth version quoted, e.g. 3.0, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.1 etc, but that is pretty well irrelevant for SQ. Those various versions deal mainly with gradually improving radio range, power consumption and connection stability. What you need to know for SQ is the appropriate Bluetooth \u2018codec\u2019 being used and usually there is nothing to tell you what Bluetooth codec your equipment has decided to use. Fortunately, the MX3s are capable of using ANY codec.The sound quality was too compromised for me using the default \u2018AAC Bluetooth\u2019 from my iPhone. Lossless ALAC or FLAC etc files can sound so much better than that. Modern Android phones default to \u2018aptX Bluetooth\u2019 and \u2018aptX HD Bluetooth\u2019 codecs which are a little better and Sony\u2019s \u2018LDAC\u2019 codec is noticeably the best Bluetooth option currently available. Using LDAC, the MX3s provide much of the timbre, \u2018air\u2019, \u2018space\u2019 and subtlety that was missing with the iPhone\u2019s \u2018AAC Bluetooth\u2019.If you don\u2019t have a particularly good wired source, LDAC is quite likely to sound as good as, possibly even better than, a wired connection. You need to experiment with your phone or DAP to decide which compromise suits you best. Personally \u2013 I\u2019ve switched to LDAC for wireless listening to my DAP. I have the iPhone as a back-up if my DAP battery fails.Sound quality can be improved by a different combination without foregoing the benefit of the noise cancelling. The noise cancelling is good enough that it really is worth making the effort to get the best sound quality compromise you can.FOR COMPARISONI previously used my excellent Shure SE535s ear-phones combined with an Oppo HA-2 portable DAC/amp for flying. That excellent combination provides significantly higher audio quality than the MX3s BUT only has noise isolation, not noise cancelling. Although the MX3s audio quality is not as good as the Oppo/Shure combination, I will nevertheless still opt to fly in future with the MX3s because the near silent background allows you to play your music quieter \u2013 and that is a huge advantage for relaxation.Listening at home, without noise concerns, I would not dream of using the MX3s. For a little over 1/3rd of the price, my Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro headphones beat the MX3s in every respect \u2013 so you need to keep a sense of proportion.The MX3s do sound extremely good, for closed-back headphones, when used with outstanding amps like the Oppo HA-2 (WIRED) or the truly world class Benchmark DAC2 (WIRED).  Another combination that works surprisingly well is my wife\u2019s 1st generation Fiio X5 (WIRED) with the MX3s. The slightly intense sound of the early Fiio X5 is balanced out nicely by the slightly laid-back character of the MX3s when using noise cancelling. Surprisingly then, the ageing X5, WIRED, is the best option I have heard when using full noise cancelling.  The X5, the Oppo and the Benchmark do of course all have fairly powerful amplifiers which take control of the MX3\u2019s drivers to produce a far more controlled, detailed, nuanced sound that the built-in amp can manage. With those external amps, even the bass is tuneful and the MX3s cope with quite dense, complicated music without getting too confused. Relying on their own built-in DAC &amp; amp, the sound can get a bit muddled on complex music but simple music is very satisfying and better for relaxing of course. The MX3s tonal balance is pretty even and bass is not exaggerated, which makes a nice change.With the right matching equipment the MX3s are more than acceptable, they are excellent, for closed-back headphones.  Be warned though, even with a simple WIRED player, like my Sansa Clip Zip, the sound quality is better than using an iPhone on \u2018AAC Bluetooth\u2019.There are some fairly cheap digital audio players (DAPs) on the market with user-selectable Bluetooth codecs. Three small but appealing ones are the \u2018Shandling M0\u2019, the \u2018Sony NW A45\u2019 and the \u2018FiiO M7\u2019 (which I now have). None of those are anywhere near the best for wired headphone connections but each of them work just fine as a wireless source because the wireless headphones do not use the budget DAP\u2019s DAC or amp. The right DAPs, including all of the above examples, allow you to select from the most basic \u2018SBC Bluetooth\u2019 through to the best quality \u2018LDAC\u2019. You can therefore experiment and achieve the best wireless performance that the MX3s and your DAP will provide - with the music files you are using. Because you are using the headphones\u2019 own DAC &amp; amp, you don\u2019t need an expensive DAC &amp; amp in your DAP \u2013 that is why these budget wireless DAPs are pretty well ideal for use with wireless headphones.THE APPI initially used one of the \u2018user\u2019 profiles to give a VERY slight treble increase \u2013 which I thought helped a little with my iPhone but when I subsequently deleted the app I got the impression that the audio quality over-all had improved slightly with the iPhone. That is difficult to prove, and it may just be my bias, but that\u2019s how I felt.Perhaps all that signal processing is hindering rather than helping? Do try them both with and without the app. You may or may not agree with me but I don\u2019t use the app any more.CONCLUSIONDespite the glowing reviews, these are not perfect headphones, they are however an extremely good compromise. I am delighted with them and pleased that I took a bit of time to get the best out of them. If you don\u2019t bother to achieve the best sound quality, you will still have the benefit of that superb noise cancelling.", "Lets start by saying I have a couple of pairs of Sony premium noise cancellers (MDR-1RNC and MDR-100ABN) and have borrowed B*SE QC35, I have been pretty pleased with the Sony units (easily beating the best that B*SE can offer), so keen to see what these can do, and if they can raise the bar even higher, as so often with products these days, each new version of a product performs pretty much like the last ones, and improvements are very small increments and refinements.  This is why I was totally gobsmacked about the leap that Sony have made with these.  I will try and break my review down into logical sections, but in short (if you don't want to read my full review), Sony have not just knocked it out the park with these, the ball isn't even in the same city...  I don't offer up 5 stars easily on \u00a3300 headphones, but it's really hard to fault these, and they truly deliver a new class in performance.Sound Quality  5/5=================40mm drivers (like previous Sony models), but there is obviously some  serious upgrades been going on, Fed this some FLAC HD classic rock, and I found the sound quality to be superb, with deep bass, clear treble and great spacial separation, Hooked up to my Google Pixel 2 Android phone that picked the LDAC HD Audio Bluetooth profile, it was hard to spot much difference between the wired and Bluetooth connections, no longer do we have to sacrifice convenience of wireless over sound quality.  If you are going to pick up these, I highly recommend making sure your phone does LDAC Audio (It's part of Android 8.0 onward, and also available on some older Sony phones too).  Of course the headphones with with standard Bluetooth, and sound quality is good, but Bluetooth is the limiting factor on older phones and devices that don't do LDAC.  You are also well catered for with APT-X (HD and regular) profiles and the fallback AAC and SBC.Comfort 4/5==========As I mentioned, I have 2 Sony noise cancellers, but the pair I keep at work (MDR-1RNC), I do so because they are so comfortable, more than any other headphones I have ever worn, so are my reference for comfort.  Are these as comfortable?  Not quite, but close.  They are certainly more comfortable that recent Sony offerings, so they are heading in the right direction, and I wouldn't have a problem wearing these for extended periods and long flights..Battery Performance  5/5====================Amazing.  30hrs from full charge, with Bluetooth and noise cancelling, and I have no reason to doubt that figure.  Been using them all day at work, and it's barely registered on the battery (battery charge is reported over Bluetooth on supported phones).  There is also a quick charge, where a 10min charge will give 5hrs.  Very impressive indeed.Noise Cancellation 5/5==================In-flight, unbeatable, truly best on the market, bar none.  The noise cancelling processor is really impressive.  However I also use them at work regularly with noisy air conditioner and busy office, and they are superb, and Sony have made some serious improvements in the already great performance of last gen models.  It seems far more capable of blocking out office chatter and more effective at eliminating fixed low frequency.  I would be very surprised if there is anything on the market that comes even remotely close to these noise cancelling performance of these, they offer a very large leap over current products on the market (I did a side by side comparison with both my previous Sony headsets, and it was very noticeable how much better these were),  I also noticed my other headsets, when you turn on Noise Cancellation modes, you lost some audio fidelity, but that is pretty much eliminated with these.  There is a calibration function for the noise cancellation, where is analyses the background noise and tunes the N/C performance.  It's well worth doing if you change environments (e.g. from Office, to Bus to a Plane).  A long press on the NC button on the headphone, or it can be done via the app.Usability 3/5=========There are only 2 buttons on the headset itself, and combinations of long presses and such you can control power, pairing and noise cancelling mode, ambient sound mode.  In addition to the main buttons, you have gesture control on the right \"can\". You can swipe left/right for next/previous track, up/down for volume, and this takes some getting used to, I have marked this back a bit in the area, as you can't see the gesture you are making, I had some trouble initially, where a volume down would be mixed with a back gesture.  double tap to play pause, this worked OK for me, and also the nice feature where if you cup it with your hand, you turn off NC and turn volume down temporarily, so you can hear announcements etc.  I usually use the controls on my phone anyway, so some people might not ever use this stuff.  Might be nice if the app could disable gestures, or had some calibration, so it would learn from how you do gestures, might make it a bit more accurate.  I would say, none of this breaks the product in any way, so don't let it put you off, just don't make it your primary buying reason, you might end up disappointed.  EDIT: FIRMWARE UPDATE ALLOWS GESTURES TO BE DISABLED. THANKS FOR LISTENING SONY!Other Features============Last up, The phone application (Android tested).  Now usually phone companion apps are mostly worthless, here however is definitely not the case.  As soon as I opened the app, it offered me a firmware update to V2 firmware, which added Google Assistant functionality, update took about 20mins, but easy to do and worthwhile.  The app allows you to control many other settings, and tweak the headphones to surroundings, and fine tune it;s performance.  Most notable for me, fixes my major gripe with my MDR-100ABN, namely the ability to disable the power save feature,  means you can just have noise cancellation without listening to music. Finally!!!!  Only taken 3 years to add this!!!  No more headphones turning off when you just want NC.  The app adds real value to the product.Packaging (see pics), really nice, the case feels premium, with loads of attention to detail, and includes 3.5mm lead, USB-C charging lead, plane audio splitter plug, and also includes a template on how to put them back in, along with reminders of the touch gestures, a very nice detail  (you can take it out, but I left mine in).  It's truly surprising how tidy this packs away, how compact the packaging is, and the performance it delivers when on your head.3 Months In=========absolutely love these, use them all the time, and still in awe at how good they are.  New firmware with new features,  Amazon Alexa support (in addition to Google Assistant that was added a few months back), and the onboard voice prompts are now available in most languages (it takes a few minutes to upload a language change). Well done to Sony to continue to make what was already easily the best NC headphones on the market even better.", "Let's be totally clear on this using with more than one device - THIS DOES NOT WORK with the WH-1000XM3 on iOS. I have paired with an iPhone and an iPad and it can't switch between them unless you physically disconnect on the other device. For example as I type this they are connected to the iPad. The Sony app on my phone tells me that they are connected yet Spotify plays through the phone speakers not the headphones, as it's really still connected to the iPad. There is nothing I can do on the phone or headphones to change this. I need to go to the iPad and then disconnect the headphones. This may sound a trivial thing but trust me after doing it only a couple of times - it becomes hugely frustrating. I can buy a really cheap pair of wireless headphones by a \"Mickey Mouse\" manufacturer that can do this just fine. QC35 does this fine, Beats also, and they are all cheaper. Please DO NOT BUY if you think you'll need to use more than one iOS device. And the worst thing is - it's all software so Sony could make this work but they haven't. This is unacceptable at the huge price of these headphone. Sony you should be ashamed of yourself!!!", "I bought the previous model, the 1000XM2, last year, but I sent it back in the end -- whilst it was good in many ways, it wasn't three hundred quid good. This new model improves on the old one in many respects, but it's still a rather flawed product. I had an opportunity to try this alongside the nearest competitors -- the Bose QC35ii and the Sennheiser Momentum 2 wireless. In the end I bought this one.Good points first.Noise cancelling -- it's amazing. All three of the products I tried have great noise cancelling. The Sony has the nice feature of being able to kill the noise cancelling with a simple hand gesture, and this can be very useful in practice. The noise cancellation level is, in principle, adjustable using a smartphone app, but this isn't useful for me -- see below. The NC works best with the kinds of constant drones and rumbling that you get in an office, or whilst travelling. No NC headphone I've tried has worked well for blocking speech, or other folks' music, and these are no exception.Comfort -- for my head, the 1000MX3 is almost as comfortable as the Bose product. Both are hugely more comfortable than the Sennheiser. Although this model looks and weighs much the same as the 1000XM2, it's much more comfortable, for reasons that I'm not able to determine. Maybe a subtle difference in weight distribution?  I've not found any headphone that I can wear without a break for more than an hour or so -- my ears just get too sweaty.  Still, even after several hours, this one isn't actually painful (the Sennheiser was), it's just a little irritating.Sound leakage -- there is none, at the kinds of volume I listen at. The Bose was leaky enough to annoy people near me. The Sennheiser was also non-leaky, but it had very tight-fitting ear-cups, so that's what I would have expected. This headphone is essentially non-leaky without clamping my ears.Versatility -- this headphone can be used wired or wireless, with or without NC. When wired it will work with no battery (some of the Bose products still won't). Sound quality when wired and wireless are pretty indistinguishable to my ears. I found the sound more to my liking than the Bose, but a little less than the Sennheiser. However, this is a very personal thing, and I regard all three as fine for casual listening. For serious, critical listening or studio use, no mass-market headphone will do the trick. Incidentally, the cable for wired operation appears to be a standard 3.5mm stereo cable, and can probably be replaced with a more robust one if required.Connection strength -- no problems at all. In particular, I don't find that doing other network things on my Android phone interferes with playback to this headphone, and that has been a problem with other headphones I've used.Battery life -- seems to be about 20-30 hours, depending on how I use it. The Bose and Sennheiser products were about the same.Bluetooth latency -- unless you're really fussy, the audio latency on Bluetooth is short enough that this headphone is OK for watching video. Of course, I appreciate that some people are more fussy about this than I am. You can always revert to wired operation if the latency is too irritating.Now the less good...Controls -- gesture controls are all over the place. It seems that a lot of people complained that gesture control was too sensitive in the 1000XM2. In my XM3 it's basically unusable. The tap to play/pause needs three or four goes to make it work. The ear-cupping gesture to disable the NC works fine. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, but I would prefer ordinary buttons to control playback.App features -- all of the fancy app-controlled features, like stereo image and EQ, require the phone to be put into a lower-quality Bluetooth mode. Since Bluetooth sound quality is already marginal, I won't be doing that.Instructions -- basically, these suck. There's some information on Sony's website, but it's pretty generic. I've been trying to find out how to switch between multiple paired devices that are all switched on, and even now I don't know. Clearly the headphone can retain pairing information for multiple devices, but I still don't know how to switch, without turning off all but one.No wired controls -- it's irritating that Android and Apple devices use different wired-headphone control schemes, but other headphone vendors have risen to this challenge. The 1000XM3 has only a generic stereo cable, so you won't be able to control any playback device with ithe headset controls. However, since the headset controls are so inadequate, that might not be a problem. You can buy third-party cables with device control functions built in.Charging -- you can't use the headphone whilst charging. On the positive side, the charger connection is USB-C, and it seems to charge quickly.Stupid Alexa/Assistant nonsense -- Happily all this pointless rubbish isn't enabled by default; but whenever I use the smartphone app I get asked if I want it. I don't, and never will. The Sennheiser headphone does not offer this stupid, pointless gimmick, but the Bose does.Stupid voice prompts -- there doesn't seem to be any way to turn off the voice prompts, and they are tiresome. A well-placed beep would be better.In short -- perfectly acceptable sound, comfortable, excellent NQ, let down by fussy controls, irritating voice prompts, inadequate instructions, and unusable app features. If it wasn't for the sound leakage, I would probably have bought the Bose. If it wasn't for the discomfort, I would have bought the Sennheiser. The Sony 1000XM3 is a reasonable compromise, for my particular usage and preferences. But it's very competitive at the top, and anybody thinking of buying one of these very expensive devices really ought to compare them side-by-side.", "Initial tests with noise cancelling disappointing.I also have the original XM at home and  AKG N60 NC at work.With the XM3s (after auto calibration), I tried with radio on speech station at normal (not loud!) level - it felt like 80% of the sound was cut out but what was left was enough to annoy! I tried with my original XMs and the sound reduction seemed identical. Both sets were good at eliminating noise from a heating fan.Similarly with radio on in own office at work and comparing with the N60NC - seemed to be about the same reduction.Trying in living room with television on (not loud) - again an 80% reduction but still clearly audible with no music (and during quiet passages in music when tried with mp3 player)Given the rave reviews across the web (in tech sites, magazines and from purchasers), I am wondering whether they are faulty with the level of noise reduction I am achieving, particularly from reviews that report the XM3 better than XM2 better than XM.- Subsequent testing of a pair in-store revealed a similar picture: Excellent at removing background white noise (from heating and air-conditioning systems and more distant chatter, reduced (but still clearly audible) for in-store music and nearby assistant chatter. There is no denying these do a great job at reducing the overall background noise level and virtually eliminating white noise but just not good enough on voices for what I require - so decided to return them (very reluctantly) and will use my previous ones at present.[I must admit to being surprised by the reviews which notice much improved noise cancelling from previous models]", "I cannot fault these. First off they are incredibly comfortable with nicely sized ear cups and a well padded headband. The noise cancellation is quite simply the best I\u2019ve ever come across. Removing low repetitive noises like engines is child\u2019s play, but with these on I literally can\u2019t tell when someone is speaking in a normal voice 3 feet away. As for audio quality, when listening to music it sounds like each instrument is situated in a different space. It\u2019s like being in a room with the band playing around you. Everyone deserves a pair of headphones this good.", "I was sitting in bed the other month with my AKGY50BT head phones on listening to a film (that's what I had them for - just films in bed so as not to wake the kids and get away from the missus - didn't listen to music on them very much)I'd had them for a while and was thinking \"these are ace... If these are so good for a hundred odd quid then what would the REALLY good ones be like?\"So even though I didn't need them I started researching and narrowed it down to these.Now these are just for the house - I didn't need noise cancelling as I drive to work - it was not on my radar and not needed.However, I spoke to my guy at richer sounds and he said they are amazing and people who test them always buy them.I know someone linked to Sony so got them for just over \u00a3200 and sold my AKGs for \u00a350.... So got these bad boys for effectively \u00a3150 odd quid.I've waited a while to break them in before posting my review and can now say it's the best money I've ever spent.These are awesome - as someone on these reviews has already said the noise cancelling is like space age tech. Amazing.I'm a massive music fan and historically used to listen on a very, very expensive seperate system then swapped to Spotify on a nice Sonos ecosystem - obviously not as good but convenience wins.With these cans on I'm hearing things on songs that I've never really heard before. Even though I've listened to the song on top quality equipment.I can't even be bothered using the Sonos set up now - I'll sit there with the head phones on instead. I just use the Sonos now for music for us all to listen to but when I wanna focus on a song - head phones on.The film's in bed are staggering. Light years ahead of the AKGs. Again, hearing stuff that would otherwise be masked.... I'll give you an example. A film had like people chattering away in the back ground of the actors and I could hear them perfectly. I took them off, skipped back and the same noises where barely audible.I am baffled by the negative reviews of these - but did notice that most bad reviews end with \"so I went with the Bose qc bla bla bla ...\"  Almost as if it's strategic hey????Please stop moaning about the length of the cable - just buy another for \u00a35 if it discombobulates you so much.Likewise the bluetooth ..... Bejesus....! It takes 7 seconds to swap over. Big deal!Go test these the headphones and I bet you buy them.....Two minor gripes: I do feel like my ears get hot and there is defo sound leakage.", "I was at Heathrow just about to leave for Sydney, when I noticed these on a reasonable offer in the duty free shop. I was planning to use my budget but OK Taotronics noise cancelling (NC) headphones as usual but bought these on a whim, just before boarding.To put my review in context, I listen mainly to classical music. I have tried but don't use Bluetooth because it's too much of a sound quality (SQ) compromise for me (not just on these headphones, the technology imposes sound quality limitations in comparison to using a cable). I generally use FLAC files on my Samsung Note 8 with a Chord Mojo DAC/Amp, although the DAC in my Samsung Note 8 is relatively impressive. At home I use Sennheiser HD800, which is the sound I like best.When I unboxed them in the airport I had just long enough to download the Sony app and update the firmware in the headphones before I had to enable flight mode. The latter took about ten minutes via Bluetooth.The case is really nice. Compact yet protective. Great for slipping in my hand luggage. The collapsed headphones sit in the case perfectly with allocated sections for flight adapter (rarely required these days) and the provided cables.Obviously, these headphones were immediately better than the \u00a350 Taotronics, in terms of comfort, design, NC and most importantly for me, SQ. The two long flights to Australia flew by! I listened to 5 symphonies in a row before even looking through the in-flight entertainment.Just sitting in a plane with only NC, no music was quite therapeutic. I always find it difficult to sleep on flights but these definitely helped induce calm. They appear to cancel out a far wider range of frequencies than other NC headphones I've used before.They really do charge quickly too, and last for hours (though again, I don't use Bluetooth).SQ is acceptable for me. And I'm very fussy. There is nothing about the presentation that I don't like. I would love a little more high frequency response but on the whole the sound is pretty good and the bass is well controlled, which is unusual. The sound of these headphones is still some way from my HD800 but, of course it is; it's a completely unfair comparison! There are big compromises here, especially on price. But for their price and functionality, these are good headphones. I might even get over myself one day and use them wirelessly.", "Simply put: these are probably the best headphones money can buy right now. So many factors make this true: the build quality is excellent, the app that comes with them is faultless, the USB C charging is quick (and means I always have a charger), they're very comfortable and the battery life is truly epic.But aside from all of that the noise cancelling is peerless. It's like being locked in a vault...but you can then alter it so you only hear people...or traffic. It's like alien technology. It's that good.Finally the sound quality is just beautiful. I have listened from classical to hip-hop and it sounds wonderful on these cans. Bass is not just punchy it becomes your world. You feel as if you hear music fresh. I listened to Exile on Main Street and it was like listening to a new album, you can hear each string being struck.The Bose headphones are brilliant, but these are a step up. Downsides? The touch controls on the side are basically rubbish and seem to work about 20% of the time.But I don't care because I cannot hear my keyboard as I type this.", "I got these headphones for better sound quality and ANC control . I wanted these to replace the awesome MDR-1ABT  headphones .  At first they seem pretty good, nice comfy fit and the sound UNTIL you listen to heavy music , which I listen to a lot of! However , I find it sounds very muffled \ud83d\ude23 . My main player is my Sony NWZ-ZX2 (hi-res) Sony told me you can't use the headphone connect app with it but it will work normally!!!!! WRONG! the equaliser on the player does not work with these to reduce the bass or the sound ! They just take over! My head is ringing even when the volume is very low and these headphones aren't good on a low volume either!! My ABT headphones sound cleaner and crisper and block out a lot of noise ! I'm really disappointed in these headphones which I got from the Sony shop after all the 'hype' I'm reading about them !! \ud83d\ude23 Now after messing around with these I downloaded the app on to my mobile phone which I don't use for music, but found that I was able to control the headphones with it so was able to change the equalizer ambience etc . Still the sound is very mushy and distorted on the rock tunes no matter what I do with the equalizer !! I'm a big Sony fan but I really don't get why the sound is so bad from Sony! !!", "Well they are pretty good :)", "Firstly, I\u2019d like to say that I bought these from another retailer offering a longer guarantee.I have a pair of B&amp;W PXs, so during this review I will be making comparisons between the XM3 and the PX.Last time around, when I was looking for my first pair of ANC headphones, I didn\u2019t so much fancy the Bose QC35ii since their sound quality wasn\u2019t considered to be up to the standard of the PX or the XM2. When I tried the XM2 demos in store, their soundstage was a little flat and my ears began sweating after listening to one song. Hence, I went for the PX.Fast forward to now. I love my PX dearly, but due to where I live I am slightly afraid of wearing them out in public. Their design very much makes them an inconspicuous choice of headphones, and besides, I didn\u2019t rate the quality of their ANC in public - a lot of sound still came through.The XM3 was announced and came into stores. I was so impressed by the demo that I couldn\u2019t resist. When they arrived, I gave them a little bit of burn in to start them on their way, but the initial impressions were already good. The design is simple, sticking to the same model of the previous 1000XM iterations, but the copper accents give them an understatedly premium look. I\u2019m crossing my fingers that the cracking problem that plagued the XM1 and XM2 hasn\u2019t carried over (all is fine so far!). I found the bass to be more present on the XM3 than the PX, though not overwhelming. However my view may be slightly biased by the fact that my typical listening genres (house and DnB) are more bass driven. I can see how people who listen to other genres could suggest that the bass on these cans is excessive. The soundstage is wonderful on these headphones. While the PX are renowned for their airy, neutral sound signature, in comparison with the XM3 they do put a focus on on mids, which made me feel as if I was inside the music. There is definite separation, but everything is still fairly close to you. Listening to the XM3, I feel like I\u2019m in a room with music playing and I can position each element precisely around the room. It\u2019s very hard to describe without listening to each pair yourself. Mids and highs come across very clearly on the XM3 but are just a touch more detailed on the PX as a result of the less intrusive bass. But it all comes down to personal preference. All things considered, if I\u2019m listening to dance or DnB, I\u2019ll most likely pick up the XM3, most other genres and I\u2019ll put on the PX.Now, the noise cancelling. There isn\u2019t much competition between the two headphones. As other reviews state, the higher the level of ANC on the PX, the worse the sound quality becomes. Let\u2019s not take anything away from them though, with no ANC enabled, they are superb. However in practical use, the PX ANC didn\u2019t quite stand up to the competitors when I tried it out in public. The low hum of engines was cancelled out, but most other sounds found their way through. On the other hand, the ANC on the XM3 far exceeded my expectations. If you put the headphones on and switch them on, as soon as ANC is applied the difference is stark. Of course, no headphones have 100% NC effectiveness, but these come close. Even being able to reduce the music volume from 75% down to ~40% means I don\u2019t have to deafen myself any more to drown out the outside world. I like how they have different settings for allowing ambient sounds. It can be useful for people who want to be aware of their surroundings. I find that for my personal taste, paradoxically, the level of ambient sound that I like passing through is on the full ANC setting, as I can still hear enough approaching traffic to keep my bearings when walking.In terms of the battery life, the XM3 last an eternity. Using the charge they held out of the box (80%), they lasted 3 weeks with more or less an hour of usage per day, between the ambient and full noise cancelling settings. Again, very impressed.Comfort. There is night and day between the XM2 and XM3. One of the main reasons that I chose the PX over the XM2 was because the earpads were sort of thick and my head became clammy after wearing the XM2 for a couple of minutes. In a weird way, I do find the PX comfortable. In this sense, my small head is a blessing. Once the leather becomes more supple, they form an airtight seal around the ear, which is what aids the soundstage. The XM3 takes a different approach. The earpads are very soft and the best way that I can describe it, is that they just sit on the ear. Sometimes you can forget you\u2019re even wearing them. In Winter, I don't need to wear a woolly hat because these cans keep my head warm. Yes, my ears still do become sweaty from time to time, but\u2026 nothing\u2019s perfect.Last of all, the XM3 come with a hard carry case, ensuring they\u2019re protected when in transit. There are also mini compartments inside so that the charging cable, 3.5mm cable and the aeroplane adapter can also be taken everywhere.I do dearly love both my XM3 and the PX. The former excels in their ANC, separation, battery, portability, and more bass-driven genres; and the latter excels in home listening, soundstage and making the mids shine. If, at the end of all of that, you really pressed me for an answer for which of these headphones I prefer, my hand would slide slowly over to the XM3. Does this mean that everyone would prefer these ones? Most certainly not. It just depends what your priorities are.", "This is not a detailed audiophile assessment of these headphones, but it is a personal review of my experience of using them.  After several abortive attempts to find more compact (and cheaper), in-ear noise noise cancelling (and noise isolating) units, I eventually decided I had to see if paying more worked, and if I could put up with looking like one of thee isolationist commuters.  And in summary, yes to both. My underground commute has some noisy stretches.  For the technically minded, I've noted sustained 78dB(A)+ between stations, with 114dB(A) peaks.  For the less technical, this is VERY noisy, but you'll know that already if you're on that line.  The fact these are over-ear units gives them a good head start at noise isolation, but the noise cancelling feature is genuinely good in addition.  For the first time I could follow what I was listening to, even in the loudest journey stretches. To be clear, you will still hear the howling of the loudest stretches coming through, but (for me) not intolerably.  I've used them on flights, which are frankly much less demanding, and they are brilliant, but being over-ear, you'll need to be creative if turning your head e.g. to sleep.  I can't comment on the equivalent Bose noise cancelling units, except to suggest they would need to be at least as good for noise cancelling, and leave it to audiophiles to discuss sound quality.And yes, I have reluctantly joined the over-ear headphone brigade. Maybe it's a London thing, but you wouldn't hear what anyone was saying to you anyway on that lineI should declare my WH-1000XM3's were not bought from this site, but given I've been commenting on cheaper units failing to deliver adequate noise cancelling, I felt it only fair to comment on these here", "Before I spell-out the flaws, I will give you a bit of background.  I have owned Bose QC25, B&amp;W PX and Beats Studio 3 in an effort to find the best noise-cancelling headphones.  So these are my latest.What I absolutely HATE about these Sony headphones:* Touch Music controls* Feel around the neck* Heavier weight (not really a big deal this one)* Foam leather is a little on the sweaty side (once again not a big deal)* Can only pair to one device at a time - so you have to turn off your phone's Bluetooth to pair your PC for example!!* Horrendous mic quality when making calls (ironic given the Sony's audio background and the amount of mics included)While the performance otherwise is excellent and the USB-C is fantastic and same for battery life, these serious flaws (mainly the feel around the neck - it somewhat strangles you if you have them off your ears), call mic quality and awful touch controls are a big deal.  You will find the touch controls do what they feel like.  Try to raise the volume, then it skips songs (forward or backward), and yes I did it exactly as shown in the manual and on Youtube.  This issue is so bad, I swapped my hybrid watch for a smartwatch just so I can have the ability to control my music without the INSANELY AWFUL controls.Otherwise the noise cancelling is even better than the Bose (not by a large margin but it is noticeable) and so is the sound with punchier bass yet better highs and mids.These are still my only headphones despite the flaws.  If Bose can get their act together and adopt USB-C with apt or another high quality wireless protocol then I would ditch the Sony in a heartbeat.Unlike what other reviews claim, it's far from perfect.The search continues....UPDATE: I bought a pair of Bose QC35s after Bose launched the 'touch control' 700s which I have a biased against thanks to the awful touch-controls on the Sonys.  If only Bose can *just* update the QC35 with USB-C and aptX HD but I digress.", "These are brilliant headphones and I've owned a fair few.Pro's -You can wear them for hours comfortably.The sound quality is superb. Music I've listened to for years just sounds better.The noise cancelling is world class, I wear them when I'm working with no music to help with my concentration.Battery life is great - I've only charged them once and had about 24 hours use on one charge.ConsYour kids can creep up you.The touch controls can be a bit hit and miss, thankfully more hit.To turn off the noise cancelling temporarily you cover the right ear. Which is a bit counterintuitive.They are a bit pricey but you get what you pay for with these.", "These headphones for me are the perfect combination of top class sound quality, comfort and the best noise cancelling currently available.  I tried on many of the other brands such as Bose and Sennheiser, but these felt most comfortable - soft and light, sounded the best by far, and they have the most powerful noise cancelling.The sound is wonderful, all the levels are nicely separated, with a punchy but not exaggerated bass.  Many of my favourite albums from over the years now sound like they have been remastered.  I even hear some aspects of tracks I never noticed before.  I can't stop listening to music now.Only negative I would say is the touch sensor  - it's nice to be able to let ambient sound in by cupping my hand to the headphone, but I find volume control and song navigation impossible to use reliably.  I'll try to change the volume but will end up skipping a song instead, or vice versa.  Trying to move your finger in a straight predictable plane on the side of your head is not easy or intuitive to do.  So I just use the controls on the source device (usually my phone) instead.  Also, I frequently hit the sensor by mistake when adjusting or moving the headphones which can be very annoying.  I'd quite happily disable the sensor altogether - would be nice if this would be possible in a future firmware update.Pros:Beautiful sound.Great noise cancelling.Very comfortable.Very comprehensive app to customise many aspects of the sound and noise cancelling.Cons:Touch sensor more of an annoyance than a help.", "Got these from Amazon warehouse on offer, great sound quality and probably the best noise cancellation I've ever had. I'm looking forward to taking my next flight!The only downside is that you can't connect to multiple devices at the same time, it would be really great if it connected to my iPad, phone and laptop at once and I could pick which one I wanted to listen to, hopefully Sony add the feature as a firmware update.The sound quality is also superb, a little bass heavy but it can be equalised out fairly easily.I'm astonished by how well fitting and comfortable they are also, something I have struggled with as a wearer if glasses. I'm very glad that Sony have made those improvements as now I'm able to wear the headphones for prolonged periods of time without the sides of my head hurting.", "Based on reviews the only hesitation I had with purchasing these headphones was if the call quality would be adequate.However after a couple of weeks of ownership I can confirm that the call quality is absolutely fine. I have checked with people at the other end of several calls and they have all said I sound perfectly clear. This has been when I've been in busy shopping malls, in a noisy open plan office, and in a quiet office. You do have to remember to select the noise cancelling at your end that fits your need, but that doesn't effect anything for the person at the other end.Concerning 2 devices being connected at the same time... you CAN do this in the sense that you can have one device connected for calls and another device for music (so long as the devices you are connecting the headphones to are capable of being selected as music or headset exclusively). I do this with my Galaxy work phone (for calls) and my personal Galaxy phone (for music). If a call comes in the music will be stopped and the call takes over.These headphones do NOT however support multiple devices being connected at the same time with the same bluetooth mode. I.e. you cannot connect 2 devices for music, and being able to switch between the two by simply pressing play on the other device. I hope that helps clarify for some people as this has been a point of confusion for some, including myself.Its great that latest high res codecs are supported and when the app tells you it is streaming LDAC to the headphones its a good feeling to know that you are getting the most optimum and up-to-date sound quality via bluetooth.The most striking thing for me however has been the sound quality, particularly listening to deep bass music. Headphones, at the end of the day, are tiny speakers trying to simulate the real world listening experience where air can move properly, so I can see why bass is so important to so many people with headphones, and that flat response headphones are often shunned. The sound of these headphones is simply amazing. I still get wow moments listening to these everyday even after two weeks.The touch interface took me a little getting used to at first, particularly ensuring that I don't skip forward when turning the volume up. I find it perfectly usable now, and have even sent a few WhatsApp messages via google assistant voice simply by long presses on the touch interface and dictating my message.If you are not sure about buying these I would say don't hesitate. Yes, you could wait for the M4's, but any improvements will be minor, at higher cost.Hope that helps!!", "I have many pairs of headphones but thought I'd treat myself to another pair so chose these, and what a choice.Comfort. I can wear these for hours at a time without any problem. Your ears get warm in hot weather but any pair of over ear headphones are the same in my experience.Sound. Highly customisable app for sound. Lots of presets and some settings you can personalise. If you like bass these will give it you without sounding muddy. You'll be able to eq these to exactly how you like ni matter what type of music you listen to. Using them for video you'll find they have a wide sound stage and action films will be immersive. No lag watching YouTube or any streaming service. They're solid performers.Noise Cancelling. Unbelievably good. Again in the app it's highly customisable. You can set it to a point where there's almost no outside noise coming through to the headphones. You can place your palm over the right earcup and hear when someone's talking to you. The amount of technology in the right earcup is unbelievable. You use gestures to turn the volume up and down. Swipe forward to skip a track, swipe backward to go back to the start of a track or back one track.One downside is you can only connect to one device. I have cheaper headphones that connect to two. Some people might not like that but I've managed with no problem.They are expensive headphones but the sound quality, the customisable app, noise cancelling and comfort they are worth it. I use these headphones more than any others now as they've grown on me that much. If you would like a pair of great sounding headphones with awesome noise cancelling then you wont go wrong with these.", "I took the plunge and upgraded my 1000xm2 to the 1000xm3's a few months back and while the upgrade was worth it, the 1000xm3's did have some drawbacks.That is not to say that these headphones are not good! They're a definite improvement over that last two iterations, and if Sony continue to improve their headphones at the speed they currently are I wonder how the 1000xm4's will do against the Bose Headphones 700 when they launch.Lastly, this review isn't a technical one, rather a comparison of the current m3's vs the m2's.Firstly, what does the m3's do better than the last generation?In order, from most important I must say: Noise cancelling, sound, battery life, charging speed, comfort, and the USB-C connection.The noise cancelling is a definite improvement! I take the bus every day, take a train every now and then and I am due to go on a flight so it's important for me to block out as much noise as possible. These block out so much more it is quite amazing. Compared to the xm2's, the xm3's seem to really lower that hissing sound when no music is playing and noise cancelling is on. I am still not too sure what's causing that very faint noise on either pair but it isn't apparent on the Bose QC35s. I think it may be that the mic is generating unwanted white noise potentially due to it being lower quality (and the mic is used for noise cancelling). Regardless, that hissing noise is drastically reduced on the xm3's.Additionally, the xm3's just out right block a lot more and it's so amazing listening to crystal clear, uninterrupted music on the bus. Amazing.Now on to sound. I can't really say they're a LOT better, but one thing is for sure; they bumped the bass up a notch. The treble performance is slightly improved over the xm2's but I still greatly prefer the Bose QC35 treble performance. Come on Sony, work on the treble! The extra bass as well adds more energy to the music, and isn't too overpowering. Actually, I prefer it! The mids are super clear, just like the xm2's.The xm3's are also a lot comfier in a way, but the headband is actually worse for me as it puts more concentrated pressure on the head causing it to ache and for me to readjust every 20 minutes or so. The xm2's seemed to spread out the pressure on the top of the head more evenly and I never had this issue. Other than that, comfort is an improvement but not a huge one (and I still think Bose has better comfort on their QC35s).Battery life and charging speed has been improved yet again. I can easily get a week or more's worth of listening in just a 1 hour charge. The xm3's use the improved technology in USB-C to make this possible. The xm2 certainly charged fast, but the xm3's just entirely remove the worst wireless hassle - charging. Huge improvement!Personally, I think Sony took a step back in the design. The xm2's felt more premium and solid, the headband was visibly pure metal, and it had a faux leather design on the earpieces. The only thing the xm3's have showing for it is that they look less cylindrical from front view and that copper coloured accent for the logo and the NC mics.One last thing is the music controls. Sony have stuck to their capacitive controls on the right earpiece. The idea was that you can swipe and tap to skip, play/pause, control volume and answer phone calls. The xm2's did a good job, but I found myself frequently making mistakes and accidentally skipping songs when I intended to turn up the volume. It's actually something I never got used to, even after using the headphones for a year. But man... the xm3's are a lot worse. Quite literally half the time it simply doesn't register my finger yet when it does it takes half a second to respond. The xm2's usually responded almost instantly and I am really not sure what Sony got wrong here... it's a lot worse.Overall, are they worth the upgrade? Yes and no.If blocking the most amount of noise is a priority for you then these are worth the upgrade. Other than that, wait to see what Bose or the xm4's have to offer - especially when Sony release their headphones in or around August (approx. 2 months time!)For most, I would simply say these aren't worth getting over the xm2's.But are these still amazing headphones?! Heck yeah!", "I've recently acquired these after finding them out of stock for a while.  Bought in preference to the Bose QC35 mainly because I've never been much of a fan of the 'Bose sound'.  Many seem to like it but I always find the Bose is artificial especially in the bass.  These Sony's are quite neutral in a very pleasant way that isn't tiring and is much closer to good closed back monitor headphones.Just used them on a couple of long flights at the noisy back of the plane and the noise cancelling is awesome.  So much less tiring and these can be left on to just give a quiet journey.  I've worn them for 10hrs straight with no discomfort.I've just been listening with noise cancelling on and off over both bluetooth and cable and I couldn't really hear that the noise cancelling interferes at all with the sonic performance which is remarkable.Understated look and, while they have a largely plastic build, they are really light with very little weight on the headband.If you want excellent noise cancelling headphones, these puppies are the ones to beat now...", "Noise cancelling and isolation is honestly the best I've ever tried, period. (I've got three Boses, a JVC, an Audio Technica and a couple of cheap Chinese rip-offs). It's still limited in the range of voices, but better than others. However, it certainly doesn't feel magical compared to other serious headphones, only comparatively slightly better.Sound quality is downright poor in my opinion, very muffled, it really struggles to render detail and I find it hugely unpleasant. I have to overcompensate with the equaliser of my music player, and it's a chore.The comfort is a considerable improvement over the WH-1000XM2, but still not quite as good as the Bose. The previous model was unbearable, this one is acceptable, the earpads are large enough to only overlap the ear slightly, but they still exert some pressure on the earlobe, which becomes slightly sore after a few hours. One thing I really don't like is how massive they are, they stick out and from time to time I even hit objects around me with the earcups, which is very irritating.The microphone for phone calls is still very poor, I cannot use it as a headset for video or phone calls, because people complain all the time that my voice sounds like is coming from inside a cardboard box. It's very annoying, so it's basically for occasional use when nothing better is available. This is a massive let down for a device this price. You can tell that Sony really doesn't care about this use case because even the provided cable has no microphone, it's only for listening.The build quality feels solid, but the new rubbery surface is a fingerprint magnet, so they constantly look tatty, and it's very delicate, very easy to scratch.All in all, I would still buy them again, the most important feature for me is NC, it really helps me to get through my commute, where it greatly reduces the stress of travelling. But if you buy them, you should be aware of the obvious limitations to avoid disappointment.", "I\u2019ve had these headphones for just over a month now and have been wanting the Bose QC35 for years after borrowing a friends pair for quite a few trips but couldn\u2019t justify paying \u00a3330 for a pair of headphones.My brother purchased these and I gave them ago. I purchased these soon after seeing them on sale.The SoundI found the Bose QC35 very good but a little bassy at times. These deliver good bass without being overpowering and the mid and highs are also very good. What differentiates these is the app that you can download with the headphones. There\u2019s an equaliser what works really well and you can change dependant on what you\u2019re listening to. This makes a vast difference to the experience and it's definitely a must download if you have the headphones.The Noise CancellingI used these on a plane as well as general public transport and they drown out A LOT of sound that I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s quite possible. These have adaptive sound control so there are mics on the outside that will pick up voices so you can hear the important things. With the app you can turn it on so that it recognises is you\u2019re walking or running and turn on sound control (sense engine) so you can hear sirens and/or pedestrians.When I've worn them for a few hours on a plane and take them off I'm surprised at how incredibly loud the plane is! It means if you're watching or listening to music, you don't have to turn the volume up to drown out the noise of the plane thus protecting your fragile ear drums and cilia.The Touch ControlsI don\u2019t like the new fad of touch controls. Buttons are great because when you can\u2019t see them, you can feel them. The headphones have two buttons. One that turns it on/off when you hold it down. And when you press it once, it tells you the amount of battery remaining. The battery life is actually really good at 30 hours and USB C charging means quicker charging too.The other button turns noise cancelling and adaptive sound control on/offThere are times when I pick up the headphones when it\u2019s on and the headphones will recognise it as a button push which isn\u2019t great. I\u2019d say this is one of the few cons.But the actual gestures to control volume, play/pause Siri, next/previous track work surprisingly well. Much better than I expected. And when you hold it down with a few fingers it will turn your music volume down and increase the mics so you can hear your surroundings. This particularly useful if you're on a plane or public transport and there's an announcement or someone is speaking with you so you can just put your fingers against your right headphone and you'll be able to hear everything clearly.MicI\u2019ve only had very few conversations whilst on the these headphones and they were whilst I was cooking (not recommended with the noise cancelling btw!). Something I have realised is that the Adaptive Control makes a big difference to what the other person hears. If you have the adaptive sound control on (so it magnifies the sounds in your surroundings), the other person hears that and doesn\u2019t really hear you. Again, I\u2019ve not had many conversations using this so further testing may be required. I've also not been on the receiving end but the limited conversations I have had, I have been able to converse freely.ComfortYour ears are wrapped in soft leather (or what feels like leather) which are very comfortable and I can wear them with glasses for 10+ hours (plane journey's) comfortably. They do require me to take breaks with them off just to loosen things up but compared to my first set of noise cancelling headphones (Sennheiser PXC300) these are worlds apart.ConclusionThe Bose QC35 headphones are good and have been the top for many years but these XM3's by Sony has taken it's crown and are in my opinion the best noise cancelling headphones you can get at the price range. Spending this amount of money on a pair of headphones is a huge investment for most people including myself but I'm very happy with the purchase as they'll be great for years to come.", "The noise cancelling is astonishing. I can have a tap running pretty strong a meter in front of me and barely hear it, if at all. The sound signature wasnt to my liking however. Very bassy. Not good bass either. Muddy bass. However, after playing with the eq, man these things are immense. That overbearing bass can be made tight and punchy, and you can shed more light on the mids and highs. Vocals sound especially good. Always clear and loud. You're not going to get the separation and soundstage of a pure closed back headphone but depending on your purpose, it doesnt matter. Let me explain. Let's say these sound like an 8/10 under normal listening conditions, which I think they do. Other headphones in the same price range are a 10/10 under normal listening conditions. However, the point is, these are ALWAYS an 8/10. Whether you're at home, on the bus, on a plane, walking outside e.t.c. Those 10/10's  will sound like a 6/7 when you take them out of their comfort zone. So what's the point? These always sound great. Unphased by ambient noise, and dont leak sound. Throw in the ridiculous battery life and super quick charging and these become quite the package. One more quick note for fellow audiophiles. Yes these use LDAC which is a great loseless codec. HOWEVER for that extra quality you are chained to the sonys built in sound signature. Which like I said, kind of sucks, in my opinion. Changing the EQ will absolutely solve that, but also reduces quality to about 328kbps, which is fine for me as I only stream spotify anyway. But just so you know. To summate, these are the best NC headphones you can buy right now. Unlike competitors *cough Bose cough* they don't sacrifice sound quality in pursuit of tech features. But still have crazy tech features. Also are built well and very light and comfortable.", "These headphones have fully lived up to the positive reviews I read before buying two months ago.  The noise reduction is superb even without music and the musical sound quality is really good too.  They also have an excellent range, meaning that I can wander into a separate room and still have continuous  play.  Unexpectedly they have been a boon for cooking - I can have the extractor hood on at full blast and not hear it, even within listening to music.  They also were a real sanity saver yesterday on a long train journey (including Birmingham to Bristol in the corridor) with all the chaotic noise of the train and the din of fellow travellers neutralised and quiet piano music put in its place.No real issues regarding hot ears.  What I would say is that having a low profile they actually don't look to geeky when on.Highly recommended.", "These are a pretty uninteresting sounding pair of headphones, in my opinion. Voices don't sound too great through them, the treble is unremarkable, and the bass isn't boomy enough for my liking. The headphones aren't very loud, and there isn't even much of a soundstage for an over ear pair of headphones. They are also too bulky for outdoor use, IMO. The worst thing about these headphones is their flimsy feel that makes me worry about breaking them every time I pick them up with one hand instead of two. This is unacceptable for a \u00a3300+ pair of headphones. The one positive is that these headphones will keep your ears warm in the winter.I also own Sennheiser Momentum first generation headphones. The Sennheiser's are more robust and do everything (sound quality-wise) much better than the Sony headphones whilst at the same time being much smaller and portable.", "Had them for about half an hour, and so far I\u2019m not impressed in the slightest. I can\u2019t work out if they are faulty and blowing or if this is how they are meant to sound.I need to compare them to another pair at the shop.They are also not loud enough for my liking.So not happy at the moment. I\u2019ve been pondering on buying these for so long. I\u2019ve never been happy with Sony headphones but the reviews on these have been pretty good.I will update this once I have been to shop for comparison.(Updated) After realising that it was the app that was playing around with the sound, and beginning to understand how they all work I have raised it up to three stars.The sound cancelling is amazing but still got my liking there is not enough bass and just not loud enough. Very crisp and decent sound though.", "As everyone else says, these are awesome noise cancelling headphones for listening to music. But the designers could have done to have spent a bit of time thinking about all the ways these could be used, not just the audiophiles in darkened rooms.I was hoping to use my expensive investment as a computer/PS4 headset too, for when I'm not on a plane .. they have a mic, surely that's going to work? Nope. They can handle the bluetooth handsfree profile, but thats mono and has truly appalling audio quality (think landline phone). And the PS4 doesn't connect to wireless headsets, Sony or otherwise.OK, I'm fine with wires, how about plugging it in? Nope, Sony didn't spend the few cents it would cost to wire up the mic to the audio jack. It's a *headphone* jack, not a headset jack. So the \u00a31.50 headset that came with my phone does stuff that these \u00a3329 beauties can't handle. Astonishing.Another issue is when I use them as active ear defenders, with no music, on a plane. They work find at first, but eventually I find that the NC has turned itself off. I did use the app to turn off the auto-sleep feature, so I'm not sure what's going on there. I can't use bluetooth to keep them awake because my (Sony) phone turns that off in airplane mode.", "<div class=\"a-section a-spacing-small a-spacing-top-mini video-block\" id=\"video-block-R285XBIBK808DD\"></div><input class=\"video-url\" name=\"\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91yZ34JpQzS.mp4\"/><input class=\"video-slate-img-url\" name=\"\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91JXr-JbUhS.png\"/>\u00a0My primary reason for getting a pair of noise cancelling headphones is for use on air travel. The constant drone of the engines, especially on long flights, is not only annoying but mainly inescapable.I have not used these Sony WH1000MX3s on a flight yet but the big test will come later this month on a trip to New Zealand. It is good that the battery life on these Sony headphones is 30 hours which will be just the job on a near 24-hour flight. The internal battery is recharged via a USB C type connector. I find this much better than fiddling around with one-way mini USB. It takes about 3 hours to fully charge the battery but a quick 10-minute charge can give up to 5 hours of use.I did do a little test by standing by the fan oven and the difference these headphones made in cancelling out the fan noise and a rattling tray was simply remarkable. One nifty feature is to put your hand across the right cup and the music stops playing through the headphones should someone wish to talk to you, see little video. Remove your hand and its back to the music. A simple push switch for noise cancelling mode or ambient sound or ambient sound control off.Many other gesture controls are there which are all explained in pictorial leaflet. I have connected the headphones to my Amazon Dot via Bluetooth and all the gesture controls on the right cup such as volume and track backwards/forwards all work great. Stroke the right cup up or down for volume or just keep a finger towards the top or bottom of the cup and the volume up or down will repeat.Also supplied is a wired lead for when wireless is not convenient, such as air travel and an airline adaptor plug is also included. The headphones, the airline plug and the lead can all be stowed neatly in a rather nice carrying case, see photo.The headphones are a bit on the large side but the cups are well cushioned and the headphones are quite light so wearing for long periods should not be an issue. I am no audiophile but I certainly can\u2019t fault the sound quality certainly as good as my QC25s.In sort just brilliant.", "I had never bought an expensive pair of headphones before. I travel a lot, so always had noise cancelling but would spend \u00a360. Inevitably they ended up breaking. So fed up, I researched headphones and decided to take the plunge. It\u2019s a lot of money but you are really buying your quality of life back. I am sat in a cafe now with no music but have the noise cancelling on, so I can read a book in peace. They are brilliant. Actually when you remove them it\u2019s scary how noisy the world is. I\u2019ve used them for two trips now and literally can wear them for 6 hours at a time, no train or plane noises, nothing.You do have to be careful though, they are so good, I had dropped my phone, this poor lady had been shouting at me and following me to give it back! They are that good!!! But now I\u2019ve learnt to use the ambient sound.The controls by hand are brilliant too! Though I still take my headphones off as I find it inpolite not to, but they really do what they say on the box.I was sat on a plane and delayed for two hours, didn\u2019t seem like it all, I was nice and chilled with my music, I couldn\u2019t hear everyone winging around me.I am so glad I bought these. They are simply brilliant. They make standing in a queue a pleasure. They give you a personal relationship with your music!!!No need to buy a case as they come with a nice, sturdy one. I also don\u2019t have a problem with the small cable as you don\u2019t need to charge them much, they last for ages!!!If you can afford it, buy them, they are so worth it.", "These Sony WH-10000M3 represents the latest iteration in the 1000MX range and featuring USB C charging, Google Assistant and a number of other tweaks.

These are supremely comfortable headphones to wear for long periods and are light considering their features/performance \u2013 I tested mine on a flight from London to Tokyo.- Great battery life \u2013 I got around 25 hours of use per charge even using the noise cancellation and listening at quite a loud volume. On arrival in Tokyo I still had over 50% of battery life left. In addition, there\u2019s a quick charge facility, 10 minutes connected to a suitable charger will give you up to 5 hours use.- Good control features and supporting app. The two primary sources of control are touch gestures on the right ear-cup and via the app. For example, if someone speaks to you just by touching the R/H cup the music volume is instantly reduced and the mic comes on so you can hear what is being said perfectly. You can also skip tracks etc. via gesture control.- Noise cancellation is the best I\u2019ve ever experienced and it can be adjusted, above all though it really works very well in terms of both suppressing ambient noise plus preserving the integrity of the audio. There\u2019s also an atmospheric pressure optimisation feature. There is also an ambient mode which allows you to hear a degree of ambient sound.- The sound quality is top notch. There is a slight prominence given to the bass but the bass is taut and well controlled and doesn\u2019t interfere with the delivery of crisp mid-range/treble. Vocals are lifelike and very clear., the sound-stage is nice and wide too.  The app provides lots of sound shaping (EQ) features both preset and individually controlled plus spatial effects etc. There\u2019s lots to discover.Areas for development- The phones can only support one Bluetooth connection at a time. This is, in my opinion, the most serious shortcoming \u2013 you have to manually transfer the connection, say, from your tablet to your phone although the NFC and connection memory feature makes this easier.- Sometimes gestures can be misinterpreted - for example, a swipe to reduce the volume can, on the odd occasion, move the track forward.- Some mobile phone callers have said that the call quality they experience when I\u2019m wearing these phones isn\u2019t too good, there\u2019s quite a lot of echo and ambient noise. This might be fixed by a future firmware update but if you make/receive a lot of phone calls this might be a consideration. I personally don\u2019t take a lot of calls on the move.- The cord storage in the supplied headphone case is a bit fiddly compared to other brands I\u2019ve used..Other remarksYou can also use these phones without power by using the connection cord supplied.I really enjoy using these Sony WH-10003 headphones because of their sound quality, feature set and comfort. Whilst they\u2019re not cheap these cans do represent good value for money and give the obvious competition a run for their money, personally, I think these Sony\u2019s are the better buy overall.", "Great Headphones but not much thought given to the ancillaries.  The USB C lead is a ridiculously short length (Sony would NOT recommend a longer lead), no independent charger is supplied, although Sony recommend a MAX charge voltage of 1.5 a  5 v, and using a laptop/PC USB port to charge, that's if the cable will reach.  As the USB Port you connect to could be as low as 500 ma which will affect the charge time dramatically.  The Broadsheet style \"Operating Instructions\" are of the generic line drawings with no actual instructions, and the same style reference guide has a few written instructions with miniscule text that allows several languages per side of the sheet.  I would have imagined that at this price point Sony would have thought more of it's customers.  That said the headphones perform admirably, usage time (once you get them charged) is outstanding and there are a lot of really good features (the Online documentation available on the Sony Website is much better than that supplied) but the lack of a charger considering the implications of over/under supply of current is clearly something Sony need to address.", "The sudden explosion of noise cancelling premium over-the-ear headphones has delivered a huge range of choices, many of which offer superb specs and performance. It's getting harder to choose than when my Bose QC25s ruled the \u00a3250 to \u00a3400 roost.Since those QC25s, which broke in a common fashion for this model where a poor connection in the left-cup gave up, I've been lucky enough to use both the B&amp;O H9i (disappointing) and the Sony WH-1000XM2 which was the review model's immediate predecessor. Those mark 2 Sonys were a massive favourite; comfortable, supreme noise cancelling and fabulous musical ability.Remarkably; Sony have managed to improve even further on the mark 2s. Theese mark 3s are noticeably a step on. First there are practical changes:- Now charged through USB-C instead of micro-USB; so almost certainly can now share the same charger as your phone- The foam on the ear cups has been reshaped to both give a closer fit around your ear but also more space for those big old lugs to sit in- The padding and profile of the headband has been improved. Most people report this has resulted in even better long-wear comfort.Then you have the internal performance improvements- The noise cancelling of the mark 2s was already stellar and absolutely the equal of Bose's previously market-leading equivalent; now, the mark 3 has put the Sony's lead beyond any debate. Noise cancelling here is eerie, it's an instant drop into your own cushioned and private world. On aircraft the horrible rumbles, roars and sound-jars of the cabin are all gone. At work you get instant focus. At home, you'll forget to breathe for the want of any sound indication that you're doing so- Musically there are improvements too; they are slight but they are welcome; an expanded sound-stage, beautifully defined upper mid-range and treble, bass at least as well controlled as last time and a musicality and pace that can be genuinely thrillingI love these headphones and would strongly recommend them to everyone looking in this category. If you already own the mark 1s then upgrading is an absolute must. If you have mark 2s and they're going strong then the difference is more marginal but even here I would be strongly tempted to make the upgrade.I'm impressed Sony, this is a real hit.", "I have been using the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones for around 4 days now and am still on the original charge.Comfort:  Unlike many other headphones I have tried, these fit comfortably around my ears.  Even if I wear them for hours, my ears don't ache when taken off and with the headphones being so light, they are barely noticeable when on.Noise Cancelling: These are by far the best noise cancelling headphones I have tried.  I have tried them with people talking and with the TV on and the noise was completely blocked out.  Additionally, the headphones come with an optimizer to automatically optimize noise cancelling based on how the headphones fit your head.  Finally placing your hand on the touchpad dims whatever you are listening to and turns off noise cancelling which is useful for listening to short announcements.Sound Quality:  I love the sound quality on these headphones.  The amplifier, which only works when the headphones are powered on, delivers deep base which isn\u2019t overdone (unlike in the beats headphones) with a good crisp treble. The headphones deliver crystal clear voice when listening to sports and on the phone.General/Controls:  Easy to control the headphones have a touchpad on the side, where you can move your finger up or down to change the volume or left to right to change the track. The battery lasts for hours and as mentioned I am still using the headphones at around 80% on heavy usage.  If you forget to charge these you only need 10mins of charge to use the headphones for 5 hours.", "These are my first set of Active Noise Cancelling (ANC) headphones so I don't have anything similar to compare them to other than a few sets of very high quality In-Ear Monitors (IEM) such as the Ultimate Ears 5 Pro's (more studio/gig use than leisure use) but, if you are able to put aside the cost (which maybe very hard) then these are a fantastic set of headphones.I've used these for around 50hrs of airline and train travel connected via Bluetooth to my phone and the ANC works very well at cutting the surrounding \"bass\" out from the environment so what is left is a very faint and tinny sound. The battery life is more than adequate (longest trip was 12hrs which it lasted for) and the audio quality, while 'different' to the In-Ear Monitors I'm used to, still sounds perfectly fine to me - not \"OMG its amazing\" but still very good, however they are much more comfortable to wear over long periods vs the better Audio but less comfortable IEM's I use.The App is very worth-while downloading as my phones own volume does quite reach high enough at times and the extra volume from the App is handy, alongside the ability to 'tune' the ANC side via the auto-setup which I found useful when flying due to the atmospheric differences as the plane climbed/descended and for updating the headphones software.The supplied case isn't \"hard\" as such but is stiff enough to prevent most 'normal' damage but the supplied USB-C recharging cable is extremely short at under 6in (15cm) however actual charging is fairly quick, once you realise the charging port is at the bottom and is not one of the 'identical to a USB-C port' microphones at the top of each headphone. My required a firmware update out of the box to allow Alexa use (as found when using the App) which took a good 60+mins to complete so be aware of that when you start (charge it fully before).The one aspect I'm not sure about is the right side headphone \"gesture\" area where you can change tracks/volume etc via 'swiping' the touchpad if connected to your audio device via Bluetooth - it always felt more 'normal' just to use my phone - however if you're connected to a more static device then the swiping is a great touch.So why did I only give this 4 stars - well mostly cost (Sony do cheaper ANC headphones that are 95% as good but for \u00a3100+ less) but also the audio quality which is just \"good\" and not \"great\" for me.", "The most striking thing, putting these on on a noisy tube train, was the sudden silence. Strikingly better than any other noise cancelling phones I've used and almost unreal.Secondly, sound quality. This is first rate through the wired connection, but also as good as anything ive heard used via Bluetooth. I am not a special fan of Bluetooth for headphones, you pay a high price for mobility in terms of decreased sound quality. But these are much the best I've heard. All the same for  enjoyable music listening i'd always use the (obviously better) wired connection.The battery life is remarkable. I used these without charging straight out of the box, with the indicator showing half charged, and haven't charged them since.Other features are that they are very light and comfortable, the carry care provided is rather bulky (but at least protective) and it comes with the necessary cables all of which fit in the carry case (a bit fiddly).My go to phones are B&amp;W PX, the sound of which is superb. these are more comfortable, the noise cancelling obviously better and the sound comparable - and with better noise cancelling you hear more of the music anyway.Impressive.", "I\u2019ve tried 4 or 5 headphones looking for the perfect pair and none get close to these(Bose, Scenn, Beats) they really are something else.Sound is amazingNoise cancelling is scary goodAnd nice and loud unlike beats and senns.Only negative is I got a pair and the base was so heavy in the left ear it was distracting, I tried the display model in store and they were the same, I sent them back. Went and bought different makes to find a replacement and I wasnt happy with any of them after using the Sony mx3 first. So I decided to order them again and suffer the big base in the left ear. My new pair come and they are perfectly balanced with perfect sound and no annoying base in left ear. Must have been a bad pair.  So happy with these now.If you get a good pair don\u2019t hesitate you won\u2019t regret it. They are hands down best headphones you can buy.", "Okay, its time to review after a couple of months ownership.Noise CancellationTop notch. Compared to my older Sennheisers, these are in a different class altogether. Comparing with QC35, these still have the edge. On top of that, these have mobile based software that allows fine tuning for different circumstances from \"Transport\" where everything is set to zero ambient sound to a literal \"off\" and everything in between. The headphones can, for example, be set to allow a set amount of ambient sound so that you can hear cars when walking or running.The ambient sound control can be set to be adaptive too, so it will sense what mode it thinks it should be in. This can be turned off if it doesn't suit your needs.Design and useOne thing I was not aware of when I bought them was the touch volume and track back/forward using finger \"gestures\" on the right earpiece. It looks a bit like you are tickling your headphones, but what the heck!They're also nicely light and easily adjusted. Comfortable padding too. And wearing them, you look less Princess Leia like than most, they're designed to be as small and discrete as over-ear headphones could be.The overall design doesn't shout \"bling\", in fact they are understated, but that's not a bad thing.The software for iPhone can analyse our ear shape to be able to enable something called 360 Reality Audio for certain apps. Not sure if this is an Android thing too though.Battery LifePretty good. I do 5 hours commute a day and they last 5 days.Sound qualityHmmm, okay, they are good, but as a self-confessed audiophile, they aren't exactly top quality. But these are more than fine for a noisy train or plane which is what these are built for. Let's be realistic, its not a quiet listening room and you're buying these for noise cancellation first and sound quality second. That said, they are so much better than my Sennheisers were and they do have software based equalisation, ClearBass, and sound position control. There's also a surround menu allowing you to emulate concert halls and night clubs etc. if that's your thing.Alexa and SiriYes, you can talk to Alexa and Siri on the headphones using the function button. The button can be alternatively tailored to use as an ambient sound control button (on/off).So these really are top notch, highly customisable headphones and well worth shelling out those extra few quid over other lesser brands. \u00a350 Chinese brands are fine, but they've not got he R&amp;D that Sony has. Most NC headphones are on/off, and that's fine. Sony takes it a (big) stage further, that's all.A nice case is included, as is a USB-C charging cable, a stereo to stereo cable for use when your device doesn't have Bluetooth, and an airline adapter.I can't see you being disappointed in these if you chose them over QC35, but if you're concerned, drop into your local department store or Currys/Dixons to find out for yourself first.", "I've been using these cans for a few months. There's no need to repeat what other reviewers have said but, in summary:\u2022 The NC is superb, even able to drown out the screech of London Underground trains. The app, which continues to evolve, lets you control it and adapt it to how you are moving.\u2022 Battery life is excellent.\u2022 Bluetooth connectivity is very reliable. There are very occasional interruptions in areas with much Bluetooth noise such as shopping malls and railway stations, but even here, the headphones reconnect in half a second, unlike some cheaper sets I have used, which dropped their connections entirely in such circumstances.\u2022 Comfort is exceptional. I've never known a pair of headphones that are more comfortable, even when worn for hours at a time.\u2022 The built-in microphone is great for calls, Siri etc.\u2022 Sync when in Bluetooth mode and watching video clips is perfect.The only gripe I have is with sound quality. The bass and midrange are both excellent, giving a full sound across all frequencies. However, the high frequencies are somewhat muted. It's not that high frequencies are missing altogether, but the sound is very warm (responsiveness takes a dip at around the 5kHz mark, according to other reviews). On recordings with tape hiss (such as Brian Eno's Before and After Science), the tape hiss is hardly audible compared to other headphones. This means that, despite the otherwise excellent and very musical presentation, music can lack a little bite. The problem is especially noticeable with classical music, when you really want more detail. You can use the App's built-in equaliser to mitigate the problem to some extent but nothing will give you real sharpness. Many headphones suffer from having over-harsh treble but these are the opposite.I got Amazon to send me a replacement pair, but this just confirmed that this is how the headphones have been designed; I did not have a faulty item.It's a shame because this is overall an excellent product, but do consider the alternatives to make sure they are right for you.", "I am very disappointed with this phone. I didnt buy it over Amazon, but in Dublin-Arnotts, I wish I had bought them on Amazon, I would be returning them now. They are not compatible with anything in my house, my husband was trying to set it up with the Sony Bravia television to be wireless, and nothing worked. The only way it works is with the wire plugged in, which beats the purpose of its price. I sincerely regret buying it, never again any Sony products.", "Accolades for these headphones are too numerous to mention! Lush quality in both comfort and sound performance for even those not enarmoured of headphones; these are the ones to change your mind. Bluetooth connection to any Android phone is trouble free and the features enabled by tapping or swiping the right earphone worked intuitively . The phone app will appeal to the enthuisiast with settings for concert halls, clubs, outdoor venues etc, but the defaults are just great. The noise concellation in trains and aircraft was not tested, but they virtuely removed the sound of a radio playing in the room. Overall this is a brilliant product and so very pleased with it.", "I\u2019ll try to keep it as short and to the point as possible (but there\u2019s just so much to say about these bad boys...).- COMFORT:The cushions inside the ear cups are SUPER comfortable and soft, so much so that I can go on for a good couple of hours without any discomfort whatsoever. They rely quite a bit on the cushion above your head for stabilisation, which means less pressure on the sides, so even though they are surprisingly light, that also means less grip. As a result they tend to move a bit during sudden head mouvements. Something to keep in mind (so think twice if you were hoping to do some metal headbanging with these).- SOUND:Granted audiophiles may look elsewhere for products to better fulfil their particular taste, but for the average consumer like me that just wants a good solid product with a great and overall well balanced sound, the Sony WH-1000MX3 are second to none. It really has a crisp and clear sound that in my experience never seems to crackle even at high volume, as well as an amazing and deep bass that will tickle your eardrums yet never overpower and ruin the overall experience.- DESIGN:I mean, just look at them! Such a minimal and sleek design, beautiful matte finishing with a touch of copper metal. It just looks (and feels) premium.- FUNCTIONALITY:The right side has a touch surface, so you can activate several commands with certain touch actions. Convenient yes, until you have non-touch-screen gloves. I myself prefer buttons but that\u2019s just a personal thing. That said it also has 2 buttons on the left to be able to switch between sound-control/noise-cancelling modes as well as the on/off button that also tells you the battery status. The headphones can be folded to be placed in their box and they can lay flat around your neck which is super comfortable when you take them off (see images).- EXTRA GOODNESS:They offer the standard 3.5mm headset jack input which is the standard phone/laptop connector (so no need for a specific cable) and Better still, it uses a USB-C cable for charging which is a new standard for tech products, so future-proof and depending on your other tech products could also mean \u201cone cable charges all\u201d. You can also download an app to further deepen your preferences, although personally I have not used since day one. But it\u2019s there so just try it out.To sum this all up real quick, I cannot recommend these enough. I have never really owned expensive headphones before, but now there\u2019s just no way back for me, and I have no doubt these will spoil you as much as they spoil me.Hope this helps! =)", "I was given these as an xmas present having already tried and returned several cheaper pairs. First thing to know is that if listening to music you can only change the settings by downloading the Sony Headphones app... which makes little sense and messes up the noise cancellation. It has different modes for commuting, walking, sitting etc and this is where the whole set up becomes a victim of its own complexity. The \u2018active\u2019 noise cancellation is certainly that, as with changes in ambient noise the volume and sound provided through the drivers is CONSTANTLY changing. Even switching off altogether without being asked to - very very annoying and makes for a poor experience. If you are at home alone with no other noise the sound is brilliant.Sound is not that great for videos / youtube etc. These are designed for music. The headset itself is large compared to sennheisers or other around-ear models.Lastly, bluetooth connection keeps dropping out and there is no good reason. I\u2019m using an Iphone XR with up to date bluetooth so there is no excuse for a high-end unit to keep disconnecting.I don\u2019t like these, I really wanted to but there are too many issues with them.", "The first pair of these headphones were replaced by Sony after they failed for charge after 3 months of use.This is the new replacement pair from Sony. Thankfully after putting them on charge (using Sony\u2019s charging cable and instructions, as always) I was in the room to smell burning plastic. I checked the headphones, which had been on charge for less than 20minutes and could barely stand to touch them. The right ear cup containing the battery was red hot and the cable was also incredibly hot. I unplugged them immediately to find the cable so hot inside the headphone charge port that the plastic and glue from the interior had begun to melt. I\u2019ve included photographs as evidence.I\u2019m stunned at how this could\u2019ve caused a fire had I not been in the room!!A headset that costs so much money and this is the quality Sony provides us?!I\u2019m still waiting on someone from their customer services to respond and I will update this post once they do.I can\u2019t recommend the headset because of this serious safety issue. It doesn\u2019t matter how good the noise cancelling aspect is, if it\u2019s going to cause a house fire!", "Been using this for a couple of weeks now and comparing it to the Bose equivalent that I had a couple of years ago, these are far superior. Same style of case, sturdy and zip around, perfect for storage and protection. The headphones fold into a compact size to fit the case and unfurl elegantly into the beautifully crafted headphones ready to wear. Charging is via USB and plug and once charged, it holds the charge well, announcing each time you switch it on, how much charge remains. Pairing is a doddle and with the Sony App you can customise the sound to suit you\u2019re own particular preferences. The scope for adjustment is really impressive.Sound quality is stunning. I thought my Bose were good but this set is in an entirely different class. I was truly gobsmacked at how great it sounds. No sound leakage whatsoever and it blocks out external noise really well too.Comfortable to wear, and they even look stylish.Can\u2019t say a bad word about these they are just The Best !", "This is the first time I've had some really high quality headphones, and they are absolutely worth it. The sound quality is really excellent, the noise cancellation is great, the battery lasts a long time and the controls on the headphones (meaning you need to get your phone out of your pocket far less) are great too. Basically, I think these are worth the money.A few specifics:I'd never had headphones with noise cancellation like this before: there are three options, allowing you to have ambient sound in in different ways if you want to (I sometimes have this if I'm crossing roads etc, as it is sometimes a little unsafe with the noise cancellation on. But the cancellation works so well; if I'm reading on the train I sometimes use the headphones on without playing anything just to make it quieter and easier to concentrate on my book.The battery lasts really well. I don't use them every day, but it's always weeks and sometimes months between charges. I'm sure it would be a bit different if I had a 45 minute commute every day and used them for all that, but even then it lasts a long time, and you can check how much battery is left easily any time you want.The controls on the side of the headphones (you double tap one side to pause your app, slide your finger one way to skip, another to put the volume up etc) are surprisingly useful, and they make me feel a little bit like I'm in a Sci Fi film (a good thing for me). Occasionally if you use a less mainstream app it doesn't work perfectly, but generally this is great.And the sound quality is really excellent - I hear bits and pieces of texture in music in a way that I just wouldn't with lower quality headphones. Definitely recommended.", "I gave these a glowing review but with me I have now found a real problem, although the sound is superb I have a problem with the noise cancelling! When switched to noise cancelling there seems to be an effect in the ear like a Vacuum of some sort this results in a headache, I have since looked on line and there are loads of right ups with the same problem, I have since purchased the new Bose QC35 series where I don\u2019t have any problems whatsoever and the sound is superb as well,plus you can very the sound cancelling easily.", "Reading some of the less than kind reviews of these I felt obliged to stick my ore in. As an avid audiophile who has owned and still do own some very expensive audiophile headphones not to mention a high end hi fi I can honestly say I find the sound from these enjoyable, and impressive given the asking price. Personally I find the \"bright\" equaliser preset perfect for these as they can sound a little bass heavy and muddled with other presets. The sound cancelling is awesome, and also the battery life I have tested and they aint lying its excellent! Taking calls I haven't tested yet and dont really care about to be honest. I feel to have achieved so much in all other area's for this money is a very impressive and can wholeheartedly recommend this item.", "I have had them for just over a year and enjoyed every minute of listening to them.I was recently informed there was a new firmware version I needed to update them to, did it, they never worked again!As I've owned them for 14 months Curry's were not interested and sony's repair website is a Cul-de-sac. Absolutely no help or support from anyone.If you're willing to pay \u00a330 per month to listen to your music then these are the headphones for you.Update: I just replaced the battery myself and the exact same problem persists. There is a large ammount of peole on Sony's forum with the exact same problem but the people in the customer service centre say they've never heard of it before...If Apple messed up this bad it would be the stuff of legend but these seem to get a free pass for shoddy products and service across the board. Avoid.", "Was upgrading from my QC35'is and bought the 1000XM2's when they were on offer at \u00a3249. Wasn't impressed, volume felt too low and when you walked all you could hear were your feet thumping off the ground. Returned and went for B&amp;W PX's, first set faulty and sent back, the replacement set were also faulty and sent back. Good looking cans but dubious quality.Then these bad boys were released and I bought them. Pretty expensive but the quality is unreal. The things I didn't like about the XM2's have been remedied. Nice and loud. No foot pounding noise. Sound in LDAC is incredible. Bass is perfect, not too much, not too little, just right. ANC is nothing short of amazing, a different level entirely from my QC35i's. USB C means they are fast charging. Very Comfortable. High quality materials. Controls surprisingly easy to use. The Sony app works really well with these. I had my doubts about spending so much money but after experiencing these I've no regrets. Really outstanding headphones. Highly recommended.", "I've always used Bose headphones, most recently the QC35ii and was happy with them until I tried the Sonys. Bose have always been the best when it comes to noise cancelling... that is until now.The Sony headphones do a much better job at noise cancelling especially when you're in a loud environment like a coffee shop or on a plane. The sound quality is also better. There's a lot more base and it's still crisp and clear even at high volumes.Battery life is amazing, as you get 30 hours of play time compared to 20 hours with the Bose. You can also quick charge these and 10 mins of charge will give you about 5 hours of play time.The gestures for pause/play etc do get a bit of getting used to but do work ok-ish once you get used to them. They're not perfect and you may need to try swiping two/three times before they work but it's nothing major. While I do prefer them to using buttons, I wish they worked 100% of the time.Comfort wise these are good but I do prefer the Bose here. The Sonys are a bit heavier and while not uncomfortable after a few hours your ears will start to sweat a bit. This might be a bit of an issue in the summer on the tube....The only thing I miss from the Bose is being able to pair these with 2 devices e.g. my phone and my laptop so when I get to work I don't need to pair them with the laptop every single time. Hopefully Sony can add this in a software update.Overall, great headphones, Bose finally has some competition.", "I\u2019ve had the XM3s for a few months now and really like them.  Before them I had a pair of QC25 and XM2.  Initially I didn\u2019t spot much of a difference between the XM2 and XM3 and initially regretted selling the XM2.  But, over time, I have found they stay on my head a bit better, the noise cancelling is a little bit better and the overall sound quality is also that little bit better.  They look a bit less conspicuous on your head than the XM2 and the battery life is now ridiculously good.  Having usb C is also really handy for me as it means just one lead from the wall to charge this and my phone.  So I wouldn\u2019t fall for the review hype that these are somehow miles better than their predecessors or peers.Comparison with the QC25 isn\u2019t fair I think as they are very different products, but I found the Bose a bit too bright sounding and lacking in oomph for the dance end of my music collection.  The XM3 by contrast are brilliant if you like a bit of deep house or rock.  As for noise cancelling, I can\u2019t say I find them a particularly big leap over the XM2 or even the QC25 so if I was short of cash I\u2019d be inclined to get the XM2 on a cheap deal instead.One thing I liked about both the XM2 and XM3 is the Sony app has a graphic equaliser function so if you\u2019ve got hearing loss you can dial in a boost in your areas of loss.  However, maddeningly, you can\u2019t seem to use that and choose LDAC at the same time.  The rest of the app is great and if you need controllability of the degree of noise cancellation then these are definitely the cans to choose.", "Bought these for commuting in London. At first I was impressed with the noise cancellation technology - it's really good. That was until I used these on the London Underground where they completely fail. Something to do with the noise in the train / change in air pressure completely messes up the audio. Hearing the noise of the tracks would be OK but these headphones completely distort the music changing it from muffled to high and low volumes all at once. It's completely unlistenable.I contacted Sony directly about this issue but received a stock response to say that the noise cancelling doesn't always work in loud places. This is unfortunately unforgivable as I bought these for commuting in London so they are going to have to be returned sadly.If you're just using them in the office or quieter places then they should be fine, but in that case there are probably better products to spend your money on anyway.", "Sound, noise cancelling, comfort - all incredible.Never spent more than \u00a350 on a pair of headphones before so was very nervous but these sound sensational.The big issue with them is that every time I turn them on - I have to re-pair with bluetooth.I have a cheapo pair of bluetooth headphones - soon as I switch them on they connect instantly.....not these Sony ones..I have tried with the Sony headphones Connect app and also with the app deleted from my phone.I turn them on - it says in my ear - \"connected\" - but the little headphone icon doesn't appear on my phone and my music comes from the phone speakers. Turn them off and then re-pair with my phone's bluetooth - all good again....until the next time.VERY FRUSTRATING.Don't know if it's a fault with my headphones or ios or bluetooth.....I'd love to hear from anyone who gets the same issue!", "I have owned these since release and previously owned the M2 model which I loved.First of all, the improvement over the last generation is noticeable. The battery lasts a fair bit longer, charges quicker, USB-C (so you can share between your phone and not have to carry multiple cables, just much more convenient), lighter, and slightly more comfortable too.These headphones are not cheap, but if you love your music or movies, these will not leave you feeling short changed. I use them daily and did on the last model and they hold up well, the quality stays consistent with age and they do not physically wear easily either. Many headphones wear away at the ear cups and start to flake but not with these.I'm no audio wizard, but in terms of sound I am not left wanting more or less of something. The bass is not too overpowering, but nor is it weak, it just sounds genuine. The mids are detailed and not muddied. The highs are hardest to perfect in my opinion, and these handle them elegantly.If you're sitting on the fence about these, don't be, they are worth the money and will provide you with years of enjoyment.One thing people neglect to mention is the general build quality in terms of strength and durability. These have to be the most durable headphones you can buy, other than industrial ear guards builders wear. I've dropped them countless times (accidents, not because they're loose), laid on them in bed when falling asleep to podcasts, and sat on them, yet they still live on.", "Are they perfect? No. Are they as close to perfect as it\u2019s currently possible to get? Yes.I agree with every tech reviewer out there - these are incredible headphones. Dual Bluetooth connection would be an improvement but these will be sat at my desk for 90% of their life so a couple of clicks to switch from laptop to phone when I go for a wander is no big deal. The rest of the package is more than good enough to make up for it.The noise cancellation is so good and the fit so comfortable that it\u2019s nice just to sit with them on without music playing. Taking them off has made me jump a couple of times as I forgot how loud the office was.The sound stage is beautiful, rich, and deep. At one point I genuinely panicked as I thought the music was playing through my monitor. It just didn\u2019t sound like it was coming from a fixed point at either side of my head.These are insanely good headphones with a massive feature set. The \u2018focus on voice\u2019 feature is some next-level spy shizzle.I\u2019ve read dozens of gushing reviews of these Headphones and was surprised that they still exceeded my expectations.", "The sound cancelling and music/audio quality are excellent, but my two pairs have each shown the same very erratic inconsistencies; neither powers on reliably - often takes a dozen or more attempts holding down the power button (even on full charge). More annoying still - the right hand controls on the ear pad - hit the centre to pause - very rarely work - whereas you only have to brush the inner rim to send the podcast/song bang to the beginning - even your collar brushing it makes this happen - and it is really aggravating - why even have this control - who, in the middle of a podcast wd want to just \"go back to the start again\" anyway?  And then when you want to pause, you bang away at the middle of the earpad and nothing...  All in all, very frustrating.", "I first demoed these in an out of Town Store and was blown away by how good they are, however the price was to much for me, although at the time I found it hard to walk away from them.Now I have a pair, what you receive is first, Quality made headphones, the style, design and build are superb, you really do feel the quality just by holding them.Fully adjustable band, which is padded, very light weight and very comfortable to wear.The headphones are bluetooth, which means they will connect to any device which has the bluetooth function, such as your smart phone, iPad, iPod, Alexa etcWhat amazed me when I first tried these in a store was how good they are at Noise Cancelling, a busy noisy store went silent when I put them on, it was that good and that wow moment that some products give you.Hooked these up to my Phone, and popped a bit of Queen on, another wow moment, musically these are simply amazing, they have a great range, highs were clean and crisp, mids very even and the bass was spot on.I\u2019ve worked in Audio retail for most of my working life, which is near to 30 years, and have listened and sold many headphones, Sony, Bose, Sennheiser, Denon, Panasonic to list a few, these are without doubt some of the best musical Headphones I\u2019ve heard, loved these when I heard them in the store and love them even more now I have a pair at home.", "I mainly bought this product so that I can use in the office whilst working and to commuting, I have tried to take a few calls but the person on the other side cannot hear me at all. Considering the cost of the product you would at least expect the mic to work. another issue I've is with Bluetooth connection I've noticed in busier areas the signal is often cutting off", "The noise cancelling is very disappointing, so much so that I thought they might be broken/I was doing something wrong. However, the display model in-store I checked was the same and several other users have mentioned it too. The Sony video advert will have you believe that these headphones make walking down a city street near-silent. This is nowhere near accurate. I've since discovered a chart on the Sony website that shows that they only reduce the noise of everyday activities. You can still hear people talking, doors closing, keyboards tapping etc. They are good at cutting at low frequencies but are poor for mid-level or high frequencies. They reduce the noise of a bus driving by when I'm sitting on my balcony, but it is still loud. I can still hear construction work at a volume that is disturbing. I never saw this mentioned in any of the professional reviews I read, and I read quite a few. Those all seem to be written by people who have used ANC headphones before, know of the caveats and so don't feel the need to fully explain what to expect. If you're looking for reducing noise, then I swear a pair of cheap earplugs are more effective. But as headphones go, they're nice enough. Although the microphone voice quality is also disappointing.", "Stable Bluetooth connection. Convenient.Weight is comfortable enough. May want to lift to cool the ears every half hour.Good battery. Fast charging.Nice app for configuring noise cancellation. Good gesture control.Packing the headphones into the carry case is a slow, fiddly process.Effective, calming noise cancellation. Works well on pavement, bus, and in office.The listen feature is not suitable for crossing roads; lift the headphones instead.Headphones can be used unpowered as passive, wired headphones.Noise cancelling works in wired mode too (i.e. by turning headphones on after wire is connected).I believe the app for configuring the headphones only works in wireless mode.On-device buttons are annoying; slow audio explanations, power button (used frequently) requires slightly long press. Cycling through noise-cancellation presets via the button is confusing and slow.Status light indicator is on a very infrequent flicker; it takes a while to figure out whether headphones are turned on.I dislike the style and materials (compared to Bowers &amp; Wilkins), but plastic is the right choice: it's important for staying lightweight.Glad to have Sony's high-bitrate Bluetooth codec (LDAC). Supported on Android 8.But Bluetooth audio quality is compromised by the headphones' poor on-device DAC. Sound lacks precision. That said, this is likely par for the course with wireless headphones.The true performance of the headphones is only heard when wired into a DAC (e.g. AudioQuest DragonFly USB); the audio approaches the quality of Bowers &amp; Wilkins P7 wired, but with less bassy presentation.Overall, recommended.I haven't tried other wireless headphones, but I assume they all have the same \"cheap DAC\" problem. Sony's codec gives them (in theory) a unique advantage.I use it wireless for a peaceful commute. Once at a desk: I switch to wired+DAC for listening properly.", "I initially found these a bit bass heavy - I like bass but it was bloated and in danger of overwhelming the music. Luckily the smartphone app lets you set up a custom EQ curve. All it took (for my ears anyway) was dialling down the bass a couple of steps and everything sprang to life.They're light on the head and noise cancelling is top notch - white noise (air conditioning hum) basically disappears and even office conversations are muted well. They pair easily with an iphone and the touch controls are easy to use.To my ears the best sound comes with noise cancelling engaged, even when wired. The passive isolation is poor so without NC you just get a mix of echoey ambient noise and music which isn't brilliant.Don't even bother running them wired without power, they're just rubbish in that mode. They're obviously designed to be actively driven. Use them as they were intended (wired or BT, noise cancelling engaged) and they'll make pretty much anything sound good.", "A very good balance between total isolation and being able to use them in public.  Impressed how they detect you walking around and change to allow traffic noises in so you do not get run over, noise cancelling on trains is very good with the announcements just about audible while enjoying missing out on the rest of the chatter and train noises.  Planes good to, though be careful plugging them in to the on-board entertainment as the volume will be very loud, and the cabin crew announcements cannot be turned down below shouting!  What would I improve, exclusion of less regular noises could be better and the top end of the sound doesn't quite sparkle.  Still better than anything else though!  Had them for over six months and very pleased.", "I was really unsure whether to upgrade or not, I had some QC25's for a few years now but were wired... well tried some of these on at an Airport and wow the difference up to the QC25's blew me away, the fact also they are wireless and touch control to change songs, but most of all the quality of the music was far better than the Bose's the bass is awesome and the battery life well I flew to Australia and back on a single charge! I would no doubt recommend these.", "All in all, these are amazing headphones as explained by others.Outside of all the positives you'll have read like the epic noise cancelling, build quality, ambient sound controls etc, there are only two negatives I've experienced.1. The touch controls are a little 'clunky'. They don't seem to be as responsive as say, apple airpods, and they it's difficult to get an accurate volume control on it, as seems to 'run away from you'.2. For me after an hour of use they do start to feel uncomfortable. I've read others can wear them longer than that, but for me, that's where I have to start periodically giving my ears and the top of my head 10 minute breaks every 30. Not ideal as I bought them for long term use.", "So bought a pair of these today, To be completely honest they\u2019re great sounding headphones, but not loud enough in the slightest, bass is there but not that good, kind of sounds like the headphones are struggling when you play a song that has some good bass, this is not good, especially for the \u20ac300 that I paid for them, can\u2019t fault the noise canceling it\u2019s great honestly, the sound is clear but just not loud enough, but if your willing to pay \u20ac300 for just good noise canceling then by all means do, but if your looking for much louder headphones that will cancel out the sound with the music itself then you can find them for probably less than half the price, any headphones from JBL are great, all in all I feel like your being charged more for technology than actual sound quality, this is not good, they basically throw a load of technology in your face to make forget what you actually bought them for, (great sounding headphones) I would not recommend you pay \u20ac300 for these, no way, if you want great noise canceling then go buy some earplugs end of story.", "I tried all the rival bluetooth headphones in this price range. Yes, I think the Sony M3 came out best for sound and comfort so I bought them [sadly not from Amazon this time] BUT for me none of them matched a simple wired Apple earphone in terms of sound quality. Surprising ? Not really. The MP3 file is already compressed and then it gets compressed and distorted again by the Bluetooth technology again. For convenience, buy them, especially at the Black Friday price but don't throw away your simple wired earphones yet. An added bonus is that Sony M3 works straightaway with your windows PC but the Bose QC35 will not.", "I've been using these for the last few months and have been blown away by the features and sound quality.Sound:A very exciting listen with great detail and a punchy, fast bass response. Intricate instrumental work is filled with detail and nuance that isn't lost to an overwhelming bass response as I have found in the competition.Listening to the soundtrack of Matilda the musical reveals all the emotion and character contained in the voices of the cast. The headphones also sound great with films and TV: I connected to my firestick via Bluetooth with no issues, great sound quality and a surprising lack of latency.Features:These were very easy to connect to my phone, TV, firestick etc. The app for your phone gives you the ability to control the EQ, noise cancelling and allows you to assign the Google / Alexa assistant function to a button on the headphones. I've never used this feature myself but might find it handy in the future.You also have adaptive noise cancelling which means that if you're moving with your phone it will detect this using location services and let in ambient sound when appropriate (like moving at walking pace allows in ambient noise, travelling fast will turn on full noise cancelling). On the subject of noise cancelling, these are great headphones - even just the fit of the ear cups is enough to silence most noise, nevermind the actual noise cancelling functions.I like the touch controls for the most part but I sometimes find it a bit fiddly to change tracks and adjust the volume using a swipe on the headphones. This isn't a big deal, but might be worth considering if you prefer physical buttons.Comes with a lovely travel case, a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable and a disappointingly short USB C cable (about 10cm I think) which means charging is awkward. You can't listen to these using Bluetooth when they're charging but a longer charging cable would be nice.Others have complained about the phone call quality, however I've had no issues and people have even commented that the clarity is superb.I could say a lot more about these, but to summarise, I would say believe the hype - these are quality, packed with features, extremely comfortable to wear and feel very sturdy.Highly recommend you try these!", "They are a nice improvement over the X2's but still has that good old Sony flabby bass that needs reigning in to open up the mids and highs and let the vocals breath. Like the Z7'S a slight modification and it puts these as a true 5 star wireless headphone.", "I bought these (not from Amazon but Richer Sounds) to replace my Bose QC 25's after they disintegrated after 4 years.  Not happy about this and following the excellent reviews I decided to buy the Sony NC headphones.  However the sound quality was truly awful, the unnatural bass gave me an almost instant headache and the multitude of setting didn't help matters. I just could not get a nice sound from these.  The app based controls did not help.  I don't know if its just me but I am totally fed up with having to control everything via an app and depend on my phone.  Whats wrong with a few knobs and buttons? The complexity of the app combined with the dreadful sound quality prompted me to exchange for new Bose headphones.  While I accept these may fall to bits in 4 years I accept this just seems to be the way of the world now, everything is disposable and poor quality.  In the meantime I won't be getting a headache.....", "There is only one word to describe these headphones: fantastic!I have a pretty decent hifi set up, so I appreciate decent sound quality.  Adding a Bluetooth adaptor to my Cambridge amplifier allows me to enjoy these headphones all around the house al a Roger Taylor (kids you'll need to YouTube that one).The sound quality is second to none, there are plenty others here that feel the same way and I can only echo and endorse all that has been said before.If you're budget can stretch to these amazing headphones then you'll NEVER regret your purchase.Brilliant headphones .... and so simple to connect to your devices.", "Been out the headphone market for a while....maybe 5+years i haven't been commuting via public transport.... mainly listen to music in my car.Just got back into playing piano though... and thought i double this up with some bluetooth headphones for my PC so I didn't have to keep manually switching between headphones...Though noise cancelling would just be a nice bonus for the occasional plane/rail holiday....but OMG.They are the most amazing thing... i didn't know the technology was this good. My dishwasher and kitchen vent are on full pelt in my flat as i write this.... and i cannot hear a damn thing once i activate the noice cancelling.Very happy with the purchase... was going to buy a \u00a3100 pair of regular bluetooth headphones, and at last minute decided to go with these. No regrets... worth the \u00a3265 absolutely just to marvel at the technology!!!They look and feel damn good too...smooth and finished as!", "Absolutely brilliant, well impressed! The sound quality is fantastic, the noise cancellation is unbelievable, the build quality is top notch and these are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn.I played about with the Bose QC 2, the V-Moda CF 2 among others and they came out on top.I have been using these on planes, trains, walking and in the office. So happy with this product, worth every single penny.Update 26/02/2020.I still love them, used them on multiple flights and public transport, use them in the office to zone out. I am so impressed.", "I had the Bose 700 reserved to buy at Dixons Heathrow. Before parting with the cash I compared the Bose with the more affordable Sony mx1000m3 as they had good write-ups, and immediately fell in love with them. The Bose has a very bright yet aggressive engineered sound, fine for dynamic music but there is little relaxed about the sound and it just doesn't feel like a proper pair of hi-fi headphones. The Sonys are quite a bit cheaper, softer and more comfortable earpads, 30 hours battery life compared to Boses' 20, but its how it plays music this really wins you over. Extremely musical, wide and natural sound stage with an incredible amount of detail. The bass is full but not overpowering. Moreover, you can navigate tracks and volume by swiping a finger over the right ear cup in a cross pattern. Holding your palm against the earcup cuts out sound and noise-canceling enabling you to listen without removing the headphones, outsmarting the Bose here. Save yourself a good 60-80 quid and opt for the Sonys, you won't regret it.", "Wow. This product from Sony is mind blowing. Way better than anything I\u2019ve used. Certainly getting what I paid for. The app makes it more useful.  Takes a bit of getting used toThe only negative thing about this product is misleading suggestions from amazon to buy another case. There\u2019s no need for that, since this one has a good enough case. Now I\u2019m stuck with a case I don\u2019t need. Can\u2019t return because I\u2019ve removed the packaging\ud83d\ude21", "I purchased the Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones in March 2019. I treated them with kid gloves, always storing them in their hard case when not in use.In January 2020, I noticed that the left-hand slider was loose, and the ear cup would slide down as soon as I would try to fold them up. On close inspection, I saw that the sliders on both sides are cracked. When I then went online, I read about the issue on the Sony community page. It seems to be very common for these headphones and I expected, one of which Sony itself is aware.The defect is not due to normal wear and tear. I bought these premium headphones expecting a very solid build which seemed to be the case at the time (I tried them out/inspected them in several stores before getting them online).  For them to develop this issue after less than a year of careful and moderate use (primarily on my daily commute) is unacceptable at this price point.Sony disagrees. After I sent them the headphones for inspection, they wrote back to say that the defect is due to \u2018physical damage\u2019 that is not covered by the warranty. They invoiced me \u00a396.71 for replacement parts and labour costs. I decided not to repair them as there is no guarantee that they will not break again in the very near future. I still had to pay a \u00a330 refusal fee.Altogether, these headphones have turned into a money pit. In my view, despite the decent sound quality and the good noise cancellation, they are a waste of money given the alternatives currently on the market.So, bottom line for me is, I will not buy anything Sony again. I have paid the price for it once and that is enough for me.", "I could so easily have given these a  five star review.  They arrived in a tidy case that includes the charging cable, an optional wired connector and one of those adaptors you only ever need on aeroplanes.  The case first neatly in my work bag. The noise cancelling is superb and works well in my busy office and on the street.  The headphones are comfy and the battery life seems to approach the promised thirty hours.I bought these because firstly I was struggling with the basic work provided USB headset in my busy open plan office.  I'm in my fifties and my hearing is fading but not quite bad enough to need a hearing aid.  I need something to work with MS Teams and sometimes Skype on my corporate Win10 laptop and cancel out the office noise.In addition I wanted the same headphones to work with my iPhone.  I have been using in ear non-noise cancelling phones but my hearing specialist said they were contributing to ear wax issues and I had them too loud when walking to and from work to cover the traffic noise. Over the ear are much better and as I listen mostly to speech based podcasts (e.g. Infinite Monkey Cage) I can now keep the volume down and still catch every word, even when a lorry thunders past is great.They are great for either of the above cases and if I only had the one use I'd have probably given a four or five star review, with the minor niggle that the USB-A - USB-C cable supplied is a little short.The problem is supporting both devices and switching between them.  Like most of my Bluetooth products they default to the last connected device when turned on.  Unfortunately, if both my iPhone and laptop are in the vicinity I have to actively disconnect from one device before connecting to the other.  This can be irritating and fiddly when in a rush.  My Bluetooth speakers for instance, if I select connect on my iPad it immediately steals the connection from my iPhone.  In addition, my previous in ear headphones, if my laptop was turned off they would automatically connect to my iPhone.  If I have put my coat on and wrapped up against the cold when leaving the office, having forgotten to connect my phone, I have to stop and get the phone out to force the connection, even though the laptop is turned off or not with me.Of course this won't affect many people, those who only pair to one device, others will probably not be annoyed by this fiddliness; but I find it infuriating on a device in this price range. So if you read this thinking that I am being picky, please take this as a five star review, but don't say I didn't warn you.", "I've just jumped up from the M1 to M3 headset. Looks good, feels good, sounds good.I recently read a review from a guy in Sweden where he mentioned he has problems with functionality in the cold. I thought this to be strange. I too live in Sweden and sure enough, I've been having problems when outdoors. Playback stops suddenly, ANC changes to Ambient which can't be changed back and the touch pad doesn't work at all.As Sweden can be bloody cold for 6 months of the year, this is really disappointing and I'll have to seriously consider returning them.Edit: Sony got in touch with a \"fix\". Turn them off and on again each time you go from a warm to cold environment or vice verse. Seriously? That's the fix for a 4000kr set of cans? Not good enough. Returned.", "Only had XM3 headphones, 2 weeks, they refuse to charge. Tried several plugs n even tried usb3 ports on my computer. Eventually tried a colleague in works usbc cable from his XM3\u2019s. and I got a small charge from a computer USB port. Chalking it up as a faulty cable at this stage. Very angry that Sony cannot supply a decent length USBc and working cable when I\u2019ve paid \u00a3300 for these headphones \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 - they are getting returned", "Received these headphones for Christmas and spent a couple of days with them before sending them back.I\u2019m not sure what all the reviews are shouting about! They are heavy on your head, ear padding is thin, ears touch the inside of the cup (digging in) and they are very bass heavy.Kids will love them, however If like me, you prefer music that should sound like it was meant too, you\u2019ll buy the Bose QC35 II. The Bose make the Sony\u2019s look cheap.", "These are my first pair of ANC headphones and I absolutely adore them. Never had a pair of headphones like them - the noise cancelling is outstanding. The battery life is excellent too, I can't actually remember the last time I charged them and I use them most days. As for the sound quality, amazing! I also use them coupled with the V-MODA BoomPro Microphone when playing the PS4. Pricey for headphones but worth every penny in my opinion.", "These are the best headphones I have personally owned.I have a audiophile for a father, I've grown up with the intent to gain better and better access to the sound of the music I'm listening to.I've owned many pairs of entry level/medium quality headphones over the years. From Sennheiser, Sony, Beats etc.This is my first high resolution enabled headphones and I must say, they deliver on that front extremely well. I'm trialling Tidal on my phone so I can listen to the highest resolution files possible. The difference in sound since I've begun using these is astounding. Admittedly for a period I've had to use solely in ears, and I've been itching for my next proper over ears set.You will do yourself and your music a very good favour by getting these. They aren't cheap... but I don't think I've heard the music I listen to sound so good... in my opinion it is definitely worth the payout for the experience you get.Noise cancelling is excellent, only on the most windy of days is there any noticeable outside effect. It's very much like being in a bubble with your music. Thumbs up from me!These are the best pair of headphones I've ever owned.", "Got these for Christmas, and I must say that I\u2019m very impressed.  The NC is excellent, and unlike with Bose I don\u2019t feel any pressure on my ears when it\u2019s activated.  They are very comfortable.  The sound quality is also excellent.  I\u2019m using them with an iPhone XS and the sound is clear, detailed and well-balanced.  Some people complain about the bass, but to me it isn\u2019t at all overwhelming - it\u2019s just there when it\u2019s needed.  My previous headphones were B&amp;O H6s, and these Sonys are their equal in sound quality.", "I bought these headphones a month ago so I've had time to critically evaluate them.  In a word - awesome. So easy to set up (the app is great) and the sound is just unbelievable - great bass, clear sound with no reverb on the phones.  Great features like putting your hand over the side of your ear reduces the noise so that you can have a conversation if someone asks you something. Noise cancelling isn't perfect but it is damn close. I thought long and hard about what headphones to buy and I know I made the right decision with Sony XM3's - they are worth money and worth the hype.", "Good fit and features. Useability not very good as swiping on the right ear to alter volume etc. Very temprememtle.", "Probably the best set of earbuds available right now. Contrary to what some comments say, volume CAN be controled from the earpiece itself through the Google Assitant: long press and say the command Volume Up/Down, although to be honest it is even easier from the phone. Having just tried the Cambridge Audio Melomania 1 (excellent, but simpler) with proper button volume control, I found myself doing just this as it is more convenient, unless away from the phone.", "Great for playback, terrible for voice calls and recording.Moved from my old bose cq20s generation. The Sony\u2019s are exceptionally comfortable, i\u2019ve slept with them on in bed! The sound quality is second to none and they look beautiful. I have one major gripe though: the microphones and call quality is absolutely abysmal. It picks up way too much background noise. So much so, the caller at the other end can hear more background noise than your actual voice. I mean why sony? Better to advertise the phones without having a mic than to provide sub par microphones. The mic is also very muffled.If you want a great all round headphone, bose are the one. If you just want sound quality and comfort, the xm3 M2s cut it.", "Probably my biggest 'luxury' purchase ever but I don't think it's one I'll be regretting. Having been in the market for high end headphones for a while now and unable to decide between Sony's XM2 and the Bose QC35ii I was very keen to see how these would sound and with early reviews so positive I finally pulled the trigger.Definitely glad I waited now, Sony have produced a simply amazing piece of kit. Flying to the Carribbean in a couple of weeks so will get a proper chance to test them in the air but in all other environmenta these things have been simply outstanding.", "I have 3 girls under 12, a wife and a dog...and it seems lik is rained on every day off I've had a his summer so they've been stuck inside, with me.I plug these into my PlayStation, turn them on (they work when switched off as long as they are hard wired but you don't get all the features) and it's like they are in another room. Total silence appart from the gunfire from my game. the only screaming I hear is when I headshot someone.God bless you Sony. You saved summer", "Upgraded from a pair of studio 2 wireless beats to these recently. They are by far the best headphones I have ever owned amazing sound amazing noise cancelling so comfortable on the head and the ears too, beats Made my ears ache after short periods these I feel I can wear all day and they have the battery to last several days.These are a beautifully constructed set of headphones worth every single penny.", "I dithered for ages about buying these, as they're a lot of money and I didn't know how much I'd really use them (and I got them when they'd not been out long, so paid full price).But they're fantastic. The sound quality seems great to me, and the noise cancelling is awesome. I often wear them just to block outside noise.", "The headphones worked well for the first two weeks and I was pleased with the level of noise cancellation this offered even though it doesn't do as well blocking out the higher frequency sounds and vocal noise. However, the right headphone developed a rustling/crackling/weak popping sound after 2 weeks of use. Apparently this is a well known issue with some of the headsets. For such an expensive pair of headphones to develop this fault after 2 weeks of use is very disappointing.", "Long time Bose fan, opted for these over the QC35II based on strong industry reviews. Sound quality is exceptional, NC excellent but mediocre for voice. Tempted to mark down one star due the the need for a companion app - adaptive NC requires \u2018always\u2019 location access and based on input from mobile. Cable and adapter included for use when flying.", "These headphones from Sony really are outstanding. In the box you get the headphones themselves (in a choice of white or silver, a Bose QuietComfort style hard carry bag, a short USB-C/USB charging cable, a cable to allow a wired connection rather than bluetooth, and a plane in flight entertainment adapter.The headphones represent a strong showing from Sony in this series with the good, and then excellent Sony MDR-1000X WH1000XM2 proceeding them.There are several standout features.1. The noise cancelling is the best I have experienced including the QuietComfort range from Bose and the Bowers and Wilkins PX headphones, all in a similar price bracket. Not only do the headphones more or less do away with steady background noise such as a train or car engine, remarkably they very significantly reduce the sound of, for example, someone speaking to you, or voices on a TV . I haven't found this level of noise-cancellation elsewhere.2. It's common now for manufactures to produce an app to fine-tune bluetooth headphones. Their usefulness varies but for these Sony headphones it's brilliant and near essential. It allows you personalise your listening experience depending on how you use the headphones, to set the level of noise cancellation and set adaptive sound control - which varies the headphone settings depending on whether your sitting in a quiet environment, on a plane or train, or walking on the street. In each environment you can use you own preferred noise cancelling level. The app also, of course, allows for software updates etc.3. One of the primary issues I have with the BW PX headphones are the fiddly buttons on the headphones themselves - it's easy to select the wrong button or simply forget what the buttons do. Not so on the Sony headphones where there are only two buttons - an on/off/bluetooth pairing button and an ambient sound on/off button. That's it. This is because simple and intuitive touch motions made on the right headphone cup control the volume, allow you to answer a call, move on the the next music track and more. Really useful for me is the gesture of placing you hand over the cup which turns the noise cancelling off. This means that on a plane it's possible to hear someone, and talk to them, without removing the headphones. This is really convenient and, such is the quality of the noise cancelling that wit headphones in place and noise cancelling active, there is no way you could hear someone talking to you.4. The battery life of 30 hours, with a charge time of just 10 minutes allowing five hours of use is remarkable. I also like the  use of a USB-C power connector rather than the old micro-USB charger. The former is becoming the standard and it's much more robust that the older connectors.5. The sound quality is excellent, although some treble detail is lost, and the use of additional microphones to use the headset to answer phone calls works well.So overall excellent headphones, but no product is perfect. I find the design a bit too plastic-dominated and although good quality the headphones don't have the premium feel of the BW PX ones. Not only are the materials not quite to high-end but the build quality seems inferior to BW.6. The headphones are very comfortable to use. They are a little lighter than the previous versions. The over ear cups seem larger that the Bose QC ones which means for me, anyway, they completely cover my ear and are not so tight that my ears get hot. While sealing around my ears they to do pressure in to the side of my head.I've also experienced a couple of issues with the headphones. A software update when I paired the headphones to my iPhone X and linked via the iOS app took forever to load onto the headphones. It look moments to download to my phone but parsing it onto the headphones was very slow. Also the headphones will not paid with my 2017 UHD Samsung TV. The BW phones did so easily.Nonetheless these headphones are, as the headline to this review suggests, near perfect. Five stars.", "I owned a Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 2 before these Sony. The Senn\u2019s have better sound and have multipoint (very easy to use with laptop and phone at the same time). The Sony\u2019s have clearly better NC, slightly better comfort, and very decent sound (but make sure to update the firmware to fix the bass) but it\u2019s really not understandable how proper multipoint is left out on top of the line headphones and at this price range.", "I don\u2019t really write reviews and if I do they\u2019re usually negative. These headphones were so good I couldn\u2019t resist coming to write a review. The headphones are extremely comfortable, with the best sound quality on headphones I\u2019ve ever experienced. The noise cancelling is what gives it that cutting edge though. With so many different settings honestly anyone could use them. The ability to change the equaliser, means you can change how you hear music to whatever mood you\u2019re in. All the additional features just put the Sony Wh-100xm3\u2019s to be that much betterI. f you\u2019re looking for headphones that do it all buy these headphones! Well worth the hefty price tag.", "These are the best headphones with noise cancellingon the market right now. Sony really have set the bar high for the future. Amazing bass with even better noise cancelling.10/10 would buy!", "Not the greatest sound quality out there but a strong performer. On practicallity they are probably the best out there.

For me personally I put these above the bose and the beats, I have owned all 3 and the Sony WH-1000XM3 In my opinion are better. But end of the day its personal preference. Just 1 thing you must download the Sony app to get the best out of these headphones", "I've had those headphones previously until I accidentally broke it. From what a year of use told me is that it is really great headphones, battery life was very good and lasted throughout the day. Noise cancelling was amazing and really high quality. The sound quality was extremely good for almost everything, music, games and outside use. High quality bass too!I know it is pricey and all but I would recommend it!

Of course they support iOS but I am pretty much an Android person.I have used them on Brighton Buses, a coach and trains and they are really impressive and lifting them off your head is a real shocker - all that horrible noise!Of course you still get the physical vibration of the bus, etc through your body.Outdoors however the music you are playing seems to what I describe as \"boom\" and I think this is the wind blowing on the sensor microphones for the noise canceling system but that is just my opinion.They come in a nice box with a drawing in the base so you can easily figure out how they fit in.From the app (or the headphones if google assist is not activated) you can fine tune the NC and also from the app adjust the level of NC to suit your needs / environment.The only thing I don't really like is the touch user interface on the right headphone which is a mixture of touch and swipe e.g. a forward swipe for the next track. I am however getting used to it.So if you want to listen to your music at home on public transport this could be the solution for you.I am off to Egypt in a few weeks scuba diving and am looking forward to a peaceful plane ride :)", "sound is amazing, very compfortable and light BUT very warm and sweaty and that guidance voice which follows each your button press is so annoying especially when you are on the phone and want to turn on the noice cancellation feature you forced to listen to the guildance voice instead of your interlocutor so you just missing several words from the conversation.", "Build quality poor.

Others have mentioned this can be addressed in the app, but surely vocals should be excellent without any adjustment.

The PX's sound absolutely amazing and the H9i's are supremely comfortable. The Sony's aren't as sonically capable as the PX's or as comfortable to wear as the H9i's BUT they are still brilliant headphones - the noise isolation is unbelievable - it's like being in your own sound bubble. Music sounds detailed and bright with an expansive soundstage and the noise cancelling is phenomenal. They come with a hard case (big thumbs up - PX's and H9i's don't) and a great app to get the most out of your music listening style. I have been wearing them on and off for the best part of 8 days now and I love them. They aren't conventionally stylish - the PX's and H9i's trump the Sony's but they are well made and full of tech. I have used the WH-1000MX3 listening to music from my Yamaha HiFi, iPhone X and whilst playing games on my PS4 Pro - in every scenario they have delivered.

Ultimately I thought I wanted better sound when I bought the PX but after 6 months I realised I wanted better comfort and NC. These sound excellent and I can live with the 1% sound difference to the PX.They are much better sound than the Wh-1000xm2. The sound stage is much wider (almost sound like an open can). Detail is superb. Bass is more controlled. Treble is brighter. Still not as good as the PX, but I'd bet in a blind test most people wouldn't notice. They are fun to listen to but with detail, which is hard to pull off.Life is about compromises and these have less of them than any competitor. Sound is excellent (although the PX is marginally better), comfort is excellent, NC is excellent.Oh, and if you were considering Bose, just don't. NC not as good, sound not as good.", "Much better than the latest Bose models.", "Just great quality all around!", "These headphones will be compared to others in this price range from B&amp;W, B&amp;O, and M&amp;D.Initial presentation is good. For once the headphones come with a rigid cover/protector and the first indicator of quality is here with a beautiful rose gold coloured zip and it actually looks like real gold not coloured plasticMoving onto the build quality the leather and materials are exceptionally good. The best i\u2019ve come across. The headset swivel so smoothly and they sit perfectly on your head. You can\u2019t fault them at all. They are better that any of the other headphones in that respect.Unfortunately that\u2019s where this quality care ends. The Sound Quality isn\u2019t the best. It\u2019s good but it\u2019s not the best. The M&amp;D headphones are better for detail. These would be a close second as the bass is perfectly balanced and sound is clean and clear *but* it is missing the level of detail you get from the M&amp;D headphones.Software - This is one of my bugbears .... Sony did so well to create this superb set of headphones and then the software let them down. At the time of writing the software reports an empty battery. Even though I had charged it up. (See picture) The software also only picked up 50 songs from my Apple library out of several thousand. It\u2019s not really a problem as I simply use the iPhone Music app and everything works great but someone somewhere needs a slap for ruining what was almost a flawless implementation of a set of headphones. While we\u2019re at it I was in my kitchen when listening to these for the first time and it showed TRANSPORT as the ambient detection but showed a bus one moment then a walking avatar the next moment. Not good app team. Not good.In terms of usability the touch the side of the headphone to stroke it up or down (Volume) or side to side (Rewins/Advance) works flawlessly. Connectivity is good/excellent and the ambient on off by cupping the earpiece works perfectly. B&amp;O could take a lesson on how it\u2019s done from Sony. This touch control on the surface of the earpiece is the best implementation I have come across yet.", "Absolutely terrible set of headphones. Everyone I call say I sound muffled and echo(ey).", "These are fantastic headphones offering great sound quality across the frequency range, very good noise cancellation and excellent comfort. The ear pads offer comfortable wearing over long periods of time, and the 30 hours of battery life is quite accurate. They are a premium product but at a premium price.  Sound quality is as good as anything I've experienced through headphones.I see however that the current product dimensions are advertised as 1cm x 1cm x 1cm, and the product is discounted by 1p. Sony can make a category killer product whilst retaining a sense of humour!", "Returning mine as I'm not happy with the product and delivery service.I mainly bought this product so that I can use in the office whilst working, I have tried to take a few calls but the person on the other side cannot hear me at all. Considering the cost of the product you would at least expect the mic to work.The headphones are a quality build but shame about the performance considering your paying \u00a3300+.!!", "Not had these long obviously but thought I'd share some points but it's more a running review.Although I've used quite a varied range of headphones, there's only been two brands that I keep revisiting, Sony and Bose. My last set were the first generation Sony (MDR-1000X) and Bose QC15 before that and I genuinely liked them both. However, the battery stopped charging on the Sony within 9 months and I had to replace them cos Sony UK preferred to refund rather than repair. Boo Sony UK!! So here we are.So why did I opt for the more expensive M3 rather than wait till Black Friday to purchase the M2 at a more reasonable price?It boils down to the following:(1) Sony recommends that you charge the M2 using your computer ... but I rarely carry my PC around with me.The M3 on the otherhand can be charged using a wall charger so this alone was a no brainer.(2) M2 uses micro USB vs M3 using USB-C. Subsequently, a 10 min quick charge gives you 70 mins vs 5 hrs use respectively (CLAIMED). Minor complaint here is that the supplied USB-C cable is short @ 23cm. Fully charging was pretty quick too.(3) You can set it to stay on so even when disconnected from your bluetooth device, you still get ANC. Something I wanted for the office.(4) actually that's it. The rest are what Sony say like a new QN1 chip that gives improved NC performance, improved signal processing, improved comfort, reduced weight of 20g, ... I'm sure you'll find more information out there. I say this since the MDR-1000X was already excellent and I can't detect DEFINITIVE improvements beyond it, although I can tell you that ANC is definitely better.What don't I like about the Sony M3's?===============================(1) The supplied cable for wired connection is thin and flimsy compared to the one supplied with the first generation. Very cheap of Sony to skimp on something so cheap when this is a premium set of headphones.(2) It seems to connect to multiple devices but when I tried it now, the music keeps cutting out at heartbeat intervals. So priority bluetooth connection is not given to the device that's actually sending music data. This is a bug that needs fixing by Sony!(3) again, that's it for now...The never ending question, Bose QC35 vs Sony M3?=========================================I had the Bose QC15 which were very good headphones at the time and made me a fan of Bose.Even before buying these and the Sony MDR-1000X, I struggled to move away from Bose but since I have no idea when Bose will release their next model, the QC45, comparing the M3 to the QC35 II was relatively easy in the end.(1) Comfort: The Bose was miles ahead before but now that Sony has increased the footprint of the earpads and made them ticker, it's not really a noticeable gap anymore. But the Sony wraps around your head tighter so you get the feeling that after hours of listening, I may get tired a little quicker but I'm just guessing here. Also, prior to the battery dying on the MDR-1000X, I noticed that my ears started getting pretty warm after about 2-3 hrs of continued use. Whether Sony have sorted this, I hope so but we'll see. QC35 never had this problem.(2) Aesthetics: Bose is more attractive but that's down to personal taste. The silver one of the Bose looks delicious but the Sony looks cheap if you go for their interpretation of silver which is more beige and makes you wonder if stains will make it age poorly. I went for the understated black model.(3) ANC: Sony all the way. You still hear noise around you with the Bose. Don't get me wrong, it's good but not great and no way near as good as the Sony. In fact, the MDR-1000X was still better than the Bose and the M3 is even better. Go to a retailer, plonk yourself next to a set of speakers and see if you can hear it. I couldn't. I'm guessing here but as previously mentioned, the Sony wraps around your ears tighter which is perhaps why ANC is better and maybe compromises on comfort. I need to use this for extended periods and will update the review at some point.(4) Sound quality: I don't want to get drawn into a debate with audiophiles ... aka liars, but I just prefer the sound of the Sony. I listen to rock mainly and classical but somehow, the sounds are richer with the Sony and you get more bass. Sadly the Bose by comparison was a little tinny.(5) Features: Sony all the way again. The touch features took a little getting used to at first and I generally prefer buttons over touch panels. But after a while, I was constantly using the touch sensors.(6) Accessories: Bose don't supply the plug for in-flight use. A bit cheap of Bose and something I actually use and wanted. The supplied cables are cheap and nasty by both brands on what are supposedly premium sets of headphones. Chance for the competition to get a small one over the two brands.(7) Reliability: Given the MDR-1000X stopped charging after less than a year, I can only hope that that was a one-off. It's not what I expect from the Sony brand. The Bose on the other hand had poor bluetooth connection. The connection frequently dropped off which turned out to be a common fault with the QC35 but also at a distance over a few metres, it kept dropping off and the Sony is fine over double that distance. This is the main reason I could not go for the Bose. Also the MDR-1000X had to be reconnected manually everytime I powered it on but if that was a bug, then it's fixed and connects instantly to my mobile.Lastly, please don't ask me about BEATS cos I don't like em and I get fed up with BEATS users on the defensive.I found them to be poor all round and concluded that they are more suited to those who care about what others think about them. If there ever was a bad stereotype for Sony and Bose users, then they don't care cos they want quality over image ... whatever that is.", "Ive heard lots of good things about this and i cant wait to get it.", "How about treble that will make your neck tingle. Or voices so clear they could be in your head. These headphones are outstanding.Admittedly when I first got them I was very sceptical. No Bluetooth 5.1 so you can't play from 2 devices simultaneously but having instant NFC pairing pretty much removes that problem for me.The carry case is robust and come with a spare cable for those old-timey 3.5mm jacks and even had a plane adapter.Sometimes the noise cancelling still catches me off guard. It's incredible you'll be sitting on a bus or a plane and it'll kick in - auto detection of things like walking, sitting, on transport - and suddenly the world will disappear and you be completely absorbed by the music.Comfort wise they aren't exceptional but you can definitely have them on easily for several hours. Lightweight and more padding than most headphones they work brilliantly.Highly recommended if you're looking for a new set of travel or just want to disappear from the world for a coupe of hours.", "Good product. Prompt delivery.  Highly recommended.", "It\u2019s really awesome! You can adjust to different mode of noise cancelling and different mode for different types of music.", "I bought the Sony WH-1000XM3's about a year ago for my daily commute. They had just come out and had better reviews for Noise Canceling and Bass than the Bose headphones. My recommendation now after having used them for a daily commute is not to buy these and go look at the Bose 700's instead. The reason for this is the following:1. The build quality of these is truly bad and within a year the adjuster for the headbands has snapped because it is made of cheap plastic (Picture included. If you look to Sony to stand behind their cheap products their response will literally be \"We regret to inform you that under our warranty terms and conditions below, physical and cosmetic damage are not covered under warranty and therefore any services applied to the unit will be chargeable.\" This is not value for money and I will no longer buy any Sony products at this price I expect their products to be able to last at least 2-3 years of daily use.2. The sound and noise-canceling are very good except that at 100% noise-canceling you get horrible buffeting of the audio sound if a train window is open or if you are walking without music you will feel a popping sensation in your ears which is very noisy.3. The App features are mostly gimmicky and I never saw real value in either the atmosphere adjustment and especially not the noise-canceling switching feature from the phone it was very inconsistent.", "Fantastic sounding headphones however I have to give a negative review. After using them twice the 3rd time they just refused to turn-on, showing only a red light. Searching online mentioned remedies including connecting to PC, hard-reset etc. I refuse to do this on \u00a3300 headphones so returned to Amazon for a refund. Sony should get its QA in order.", "Nice comfortable feel good quality sound better than the beats solo", "EDIT 30 Oct 2019 : Sony have finally updated the firmware to allow you to disable the touch controls through the app. This solves a bunch of my complaints at a stroke, so I've revised my score up. Still can't give 5 stars due to poor microphone quality, but a great product nonetheless.--Ok we all know these are the best noise cancellers of 2018/19. They have great sound quality, comfort and battery life. But they're not perfect, so they can't get five stars. And they have a REALLY ANNOYING problem so they can't get four stars either!Cut to the chase. The touch controls - which pause, play, track skip, volume control, and mute - are VERY sensitive and can be set off by:- accidental touches while repositioning the earpiece- the inside of your coat hood- the wind blowing- the flap of a butterfly's wings on the other side of the planet.I'm not kidding. You stop your track to take them off and accidentally start to play the track again as you lay them down. You try to save them from the British rain as they are not at all waterproof, but the inside of your rain hood keeps pausing the track every third step down the road.To top it off, there is no way to disable the controls. No physical button. No app toggle. Sony KNOW about this problem, for over a year, and haven't rectified it. They should have seen this one coming. What's wrong with physical buttons anyway?End of rant. Everything else about them is great, apart from telephone calls which are only just adequate, with the microphone picking up tons of wind noise.If they were a little cheaper maybe I'd be more forgiving.....", "Pros - Lightweight, comfortable, fast bluetooth pairing, USB - C, 30 hours battery life, insane noise cancelling.Cons - Touch controls difficult to get used to."]
